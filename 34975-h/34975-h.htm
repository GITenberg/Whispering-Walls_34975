<br /><i>THE PLUMED SERPENT</i></h2>
<p>Smoothly and with accurate aim, the slim girl
in blue sweater and swinging skirt sent the heavy ball
crashing down the polished floor of the bowling alley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another strike, Penny!&rdquo; cried her school companion,
Louise Sidell, watching the tenpins topple
helter skelter and vanish out of sight. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re certainly
going like a house afire today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; Penny Parker&rsquo;s friendly grin
widened as she chalked up the score. Brushing aside
a sandy-gold lock of hair which had dropped over
one eye, she suddenly squinted at the wall clock.
&ldquo;Ten minutes until four o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Lou, unless we call it a day, I&rsquo;ll be late for work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your work!&rdquo; scoffed Louise, but she
quickly sat down to remove her bowling shoes.
&ldquo;Why spend all your spare time at that old newspaper?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Riverview Star</i> is the best daily in the city!&rdquo;
Penny shot back proudly. &ldquo;Anyway, I like being a
reporter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you no argument on that point, my pet.
You love it! Especially poking that freckled little
nose of yours into every big story or mystery that
comes along! Confess now, isn&rsquo;t it the excitement
you like, rather than the work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A twitch of Penny&rsquo;s lips acknowledged the truth of
her chum&rsquo;s observation. Off and on for several years
she had served in many capacities on the <i>Star</i>, a daily
Riverview newspaper owned by her father, Anthony
Parker.</p>
<p>Many of the publication&rsquo;s best stories had carried
her name. Now that school had started again, she
was unable to work full time, but on this particular
Saturday afternoon she had promised Editor DeWitt
she would report at two o&rsquo;clock. She had no intention
of being late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; she urged, picking up her coat.</p>
<p>Louise trailed Penny to a desk where the cashier
was absently listening to a short wave radio. As they
paid their bill, the instrument suddenly blared a police
order:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patrol 34&mdash;First National Bank, Main and Front
Streets. Repeating, First National Bank, Main and
Front Streets. See complainant. Patrol 34 in service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Louise it was only a meaningless jumble of
words but Penny instantly pricked up her ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Front and Main is just around the corner! Maybe
there&rsquo;s been a robbery, Lou!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; laughed Louise. &ldquo;The First National&rsquo;s
where I keep my money. All $28.50 of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sweeping her change from the counter, Penny
glanced again at the clock and came to a quick decision.
Doubtless, the <i>Star</i> office would send a reporter
to check the police call, but considerable time
might elapse before anyone reached the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s jog over there and see what&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; she proposed.</p>
<p>Louise nodded, hastily pulling a tight-fitting hat
over her dark curls. Penny was already out of the
door, walking so fast that her chum was hard pressed
to overtake her.</p>
<p>Rounding the corner at Main and Front Streets, the
girls were just in time to see a patrol car park at the
curb in front of the bank. A police sergeant was at
the wheel, but before Penny could hail him, he and a
companion vanished into the building. A third man
posted himself at the door of the bank.</p>
<p>Penny walked over to him. &ldquo;Anything doing?&rdquo;
she inquired in a friendly, off-hand way. &ldquo;A robbery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he replied curtly.</p>
<p>Fishing in a cluttered purse, Penny came up with a
press card. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from the <i>Star</i>,&rdquo; she added, waving
her credentials before him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to talk to the sergeant if you want to
get any information,&rdquo; he said, relaxing slightly. &ldquo;Go
on in, if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise kept close to Penny&rsquo;s side as they started
into the bank. But the policeman brought her up
short by saying: &ldquo;Just a minute, sister. Where&rsquo;s your
card?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s with me,&rdquo; said Penny with careless assurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; observed the patrolman dryly. &ldquo;She
can&rsquo;t go in without a card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Argument was useless. Decidedly crestfallen, Louise
retreated to wait, while Penny went on into the
darkened building. Curtains had been drawn in the
big marble-floored bank, and the place appeared deserted.
Teller cages were locked and empty, for the
bank had closed to the public at noon.</p>
<p>Pausing, Penny heard the faint and distant hum of
voices. She glanced upward to a second story gallery
devoted to offices, and saw two policemen talking to
a third man who leaned against the iron railing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently this is no robbery,&rdquo; Penny thought,
taking the marble steps two at a time. &ldquo;Wonder what
has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breathlessly, she reached the top of the stairs. A
short, thin man with glasses and a noticeably nervous
manner stood talking to the two policemen. The
sergeant, his back to Penny, started taking down notes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sergeant Gray,&rdquo; the policeman said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Albert Potts,&rdquo; the man replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clerk here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secretary to Mr. Hamilton Rhett, the bank president.
I called the police because a situation has developed
which worries me. This afternoon I talked to
Mrs. Rhett who gave me no satisfaction whatsoever.
I said to myself, &lsquo;Albert Potts, this is a case for the
police.&rsquo; But there must be no publicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Sergeant Gray asked impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rhett has disappeared. Exactly nine days ago
at three o&rsquo;clock he put on his hat, walked out of the
bank and hasn&rsquo;t been seen since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here indeed was news! Mr. Rhett was socially
prominent and a very wealthy banker. His disappearance
would be certain to create a sensation in Riverview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Mr. Rhett walked out of here nine days ago,&rdquo;
Sergeant Gray commented. &ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t it reported
earlier to the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because at first we thought nothing of it. If you
will excuse me for saying so, Mr. Rhett never has
taken his bank duties very seriously. He comes and
goes very much as he pleases. Some days he fails to
show up until afternoon. On several occasions he has
been absent for a week at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then why does it seem so unusual now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday I telephoned Mrs. Rhett. She said she
had no idea what has become of her husband. I suggested
notifying the police, but she discouraged it.
In fact, she hung up the receiver while I was talking to
her. Altogether, she acted in a most peculiar manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was yesterday, you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I told myself, &lsquo;Albert Potts, if Mrs. Rhett isn&rsquo;t
worried about her husband&rsquo;s absence, it&rsquo;s none of your
business.&rsquo; I should have dismissed the matter thereupon,
except that today I learned about the missing
bonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missing bonds?&rdquo; inquired the sergeant alertly.
&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rhett handles securities for various trust funds.
At the time of his disappearance, $250,000 in negotiable
government bonds were in his possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re suggesting robbery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think. Mr. Rhett should
have returned the securities to our vault in the basement.
I assumed he had done so, until this morning in
making a thorough check, I learned not a single bond
had been turned in. I can only conclude that Mr.
Rhett had them in his portfolio when he walked out
of the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you decided to notify the police?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. It was my duty. Understand I wish to
bring no embarrassment to Mrs. Rhett or to cast reflection
upon my employer but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Albert Potts broke off, his gaze focusing upon
Penny who had edged closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now who are you?&rdquo; he demanded suspiciously.</p>
<p>Stepping forward, Penny introduced herself as a
<i>Star</i> reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no business here!&rdquo; the secretary snapped.
&ldquo;If you overheard what I just said, you&rsquo;re not to print
a line of it! Mrs. Rhett would never approve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did hear what you told Sergeant Gray,&rdquo; replied
Penny with dignity. &ldquo;However, any report to the
police is a matter of public record. It is for our editor
to decide whether or not to use the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Behind thick glasses, Mr. Potts&rsquo; watery eyes glinted
angrily. He appeared on the verge of ordering the
girl from the bank, but with an obvious effort regained
control of his temper, and said curtly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you must write a story, mind you keep the facts
straight. Mr. Rhett hasn&rsquo;t been seen in nine days and
that&rsquo;s all I know. He may return tomorrow. He may
never appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you believe he&rsquo;s been kidnapped?&rdquo; Penny
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. There&rsquo;s been no ransom demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he absconded with the $250,000 in bonds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t quote me as making such a statement even if
it should prove true! Mr. Rhett is a wealthy man&mdash;or
rather, he acquired a fortune when he married a
rich widow who set him up here as bank president.
But don&rsquo;t quote me on that either!&rdquo; he exclaimed as
Penny jotted down a few notes. &ldquo;Leave my name
out of it entirely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; proposed
Sergeant Gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His poise regained, Albert Potts led the way down
the gallery to a large, spacious office room. On the
polished mahogany desk rested a picture of an attractive
woman in her early forties whom Penny
guessed to be Mrs. Rhett. A door opened from the
office into a directors&rsquo; room, and another onto a narrow
outdoor balcony overlooking Front Street.</p>
<p>Sergeant Gray and the patrolman made a thorough
inspection of the two rooms and Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When last I saw the bonds, Mr. Rhett had them in
the top drawer,&rdquo; the secretary volunteered eagerly.
&ldquo;He should have returned them to the vault, but he
failed to do so. Now they&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you examined the desk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I considered it my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Penny remained in the background, Sergeant
Gray asked Mr. Potts a number of questions
about the bank president&rsquo;s habits, and particularly his
recent visitors. The secretary, whose fund of information
seemed inexhaustible, had ready answers
at the tip of his tongue. He even produced a memo
pad upon which the names of several persons had been
written.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;These were Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s visitors on his last day
here,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;So far as I know, all were business
acquaintances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writing down the names for future checking, Sergeant
Gray inquired if Mr. Rhett had disagreed with
any of the callers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quarrel, you mean?&rdquo; Mr. Potts hesitated, then
answered with reluctance. &ldquo;Only with his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Rhett came to the bank the day your employer
last was seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they were to have had lunch together. She
came late and they quarreled about Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s work
here in the bank. Finally she went away alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard the conversation between them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; Albert Potts said quickly. &ldquo;Naturally
I tried not to listen, but I did hear some of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Rhett may be able to explain her husband&rsquo;s
absence,&rdquo; commented Sergeant Gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She refused me any information when I telephoned.
That was one reason I decided to notify the
police. The loss of $250,000 could be very embarrassing
to the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who owns the bonds?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They belong to the Fred Harrington estate, 2756
Brightdale Avenue. If they aren&rsquo;t produced soon,
there will be trouble. I&rsquo;ve worked here for 15 years.
You don&rsquo;t think anyone could possibly blame me, do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant gave him a quick glance, but made no
reply as he reexamined the mahogany desk. Finding
nothing of interest, he slammed the top drawer shut.</p>
<p>From the back of the desk, a piece of paper fluttered
to the floor, almost at Penny&rsquo;s feet. Evidently
it had jarred from the rear side of an overflowing
drawer, or had been held between desk and plaster
wall.</p>
<p>Without thinking, Penny stooped to retrieve the
sheet. She glanced at it carelessly, and then with a
shock of surprise, really studied it. Drawn across the
center of the paper in black and red ink was a crude
but sinister-looking winged serpent.</p>
<p>Raising her eyes, Penny saw Albert Potts&rsquo; cold gaze
upon her. Was it imagination or did his shriveled
face mirror fear?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you there?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Penny gave the paper to Sergeant Gray. Mr. Potts
moved quickly forward, to peer over the man&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A plumed serpent!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And read the words beneath it,&rdquo; directed Penny.</p>
<p>Under the drawing in a cramped hand, had been
scribbled: &ldquo;<i>This shall be the end.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">2</span>
<br /><i>AN UNEXPLAINED DISAPPEARANCE</i></h2>
<p>Sergeant Gray studied the strange drawing for
a moment and then said to Albert Potts: &ldquo;Can you
explain the meaning of this picture? And the words
written beneath it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time since the start of the interview,
the bank secretary seemed at a loss for words. Finally
he stammered: &ldquo;Why, no&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never seen the
drawing before. I don&rsquo;t know how it got into Mr.
Rhett&rsquo;s desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seemed to recognize the picture,&rdquo; interposed
Penny. &ldquo;At least you called it a plumed serpent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the symbol of an ancient cult, or at least that
is what I take it to be. I&rsquo;ve seen similar drawings in
library books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the writing beneath it?&rdquo; probed the sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; the secretary murmured, ill at ease.
&ldquo;It slightly resembles Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you can&rsquo;t explain how the paper came to
be in Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s desk?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My employer&rsquo;s private life is none of my concern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;his private life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hadn&rsquo;t intended to tell you this,&rdquo; Potts said
unwillingly. &ldquo;The truth is, Mr. Rhett was a strange
man. He had queer interests and hobbies. I have
been told he collects weird trophies of ancient cults.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this drawing probably has a connection
with your employer&rsquo;s hobby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; shrugged Potts. &ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t
for the handwriting, I might think someone had sent a
warning to him. As it is, I&rsquo;m completely in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rhett had enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a ruthless man and many persons disliked
him. His friends were queer too. He preferred low
class persons to people of culture and refinement.
Why, only two days before his disappearance, he deliberately
kept one of our largest stockholders waiting
an hour while he chatted with a building porter! It
was very humiliating! I had to tell Mrs. Biggs he was
in conference, but I think she suspected the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have a photograph of Mr. Rhett?&rdquo; the sergeant
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deeply regret I haven&rsquo;t. For that matter, I never
have seen a picture of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can describe the man?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. He is forty-five, though he looks older.
His hair is gray at the temples. He wore an expensive
tailored suit&mdash;brown, I believe. One of the most distinguishing
marks I should say, is a scar on his left
cheek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send one of the detectives around,&rdquo; Sergeant
Gray promised. He had completed his investigation
and with the other patrolman, started to leave the office.</p>
<p>Albert Potts drew a deep breath and seemed to relax.
Only then did it occur to Penny that throughout
the greater part of the interview he had stood in front
of the outside balcony door, as if to shield it from attention.</p>
<p>Taking the plumed serpent drawing with them, Sergeant
Gray and the patrolman left the office. Penny
lingered, intending to ask Albert Potts a few questions
about Mr. Rhett. But the man gave her no opportunity.</p>
<p>Barely had the others gone when he turned toward
her, making no effort to mask his dislike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now will you get out of here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>His tone annoyed Penny, and perversely made her
determined to take her time in leaving. Deliberately
she sidled over to the balcony door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does this lead?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny opened the door, but Potts immediately
barred the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing there except a balcony! Just get
out of this office so I can lock up and go home! I&rsquo;ve
had a hard day, and you&rsquo;re making it worse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a reason she could not have explained, Penny
felt a deep urge to annoy the nervous little man further.
Ignoring his protests, she pushed past him out
onto the balcony.</p>
<p>Guarded by a high iron railing and fence, it extended
for perhaps fifty feet along several offices. At
each end, projecting from the sloping slate roof, was
a grotesque decorative gargoyle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; rasped Potts. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing here.
Now are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gargoyle near the door had drawn Penny&rsquo;s
attention. Its carved stone body angled out from the
building, terminating in a horned animal head with
massive open jaws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it bite?&rdquo; Grinning impishly at Potts she
started to thrust an arm between the stone teeth.</p>
<p>To her astonishment, he suddenly seized her and
gave her a hard shove through the doorway into Mr.
Rhett&rsquo;s office. She resisted and he immediately released
her. But he locked the balcony door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re driving me crazy!&rdquo; he cried furiously.
&ldquo;Now get out of here! Unless you do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Potts was such a ridiculous little fellow that Penny
could not be afraid of him. However, she decided
that her joke had been carried a trifle too far.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Thanks for all
your courtesy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you print only the truth in your paper,&rdquo;
Potts hurled after her as she went out the door. &ldquo;If
you don&rsquo;t, you may have a lawsuit on your hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny reached the street to find that the police car
had gone and Louise was nowhere to be seen. Deciding
that her chum had grown tired of waiting, she
hastened to a nearby drugstore to telephone the <i>Star</i>
office.</p>
<p>Editor DeWitt answered, and Penny gave him the
story straight and fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hamilton Rhett, the banker!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Sure you got the name right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is apt to be a big story, especially if the man
was kidnapped or walked off with the bonds! Grab
a taxi and run out to the Rhett estate. Get all the
dope you can from Mrs. Rhett, and don&rsquo;t forget
pictures! We&rsquo;ll want one of Rhett. Better take all
she has of him to keep the <i>Times</i> from getting them!
Got that straight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, go right to town on the old gal and learn
everything you can about her quarrel with Rhett!
I&rsquo;ll send a photographer out there as soon as I can
round one up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Penny felt a trifle weak as she hung up the receiver.
Editor DeWitt took it for granted she would bring in
a bang-up story when she returned to the newspaper
office. But from what she had learned of Mrs. Rhett,
she surmised that an interview might not be granted
willingly.</p>
<p>Looking up the address of the Rhett estate, Penny
hailed a passing taxi. As the cab sped along the winding
river boulevard, she speculated upon how best to
approach Mrs. Rhett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I were more experienced as a reporter,&rdquo; she
thought, nervously examining her pocketbook to be
certain she had paper and pencil. &ldquo;Something tells
me this story will be hard to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only daughter of a distinguished newspaper
owner and publisher, Penny considered herself an
essential part of the <i>Star</i> office. Even as a youngster
in pigtails, she had haunted the big noisy newsroom,
pecking at the typewriters and making a pest of herself.</p>
<p>From her father, Editor DeWitt, Jerry Livingston,
a star reporter, and the printers who adored her, the
alert girl had gleaned much useful information. But
there were yawning gaps in her newspaper experience.
No one realized it better than she.</p>
<p>Gazing thoughtfully toward the river, Penny recalled
the first story she ever had written, carried in
the paper under the title, &ldquo;Tale of the Witch Doll.&rdquo;
Another yarn, &ldquo;The Vanishing Houseboat,&rdquo; also had
been bannered across the front page of the <i>Star</i>, but in
acquiring that story Penny and Jerry had nearly lost
their lives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Slight wonder that Mrs. Maud Weems, the Parker
housekeeper, was reluctant to see the girl she loved so
dearly take up a journalistic career. Sadly she declared
that Penny&rsquo;s nose for news and mystery would
lead her into serious trouble. Mr. Parker, however,
did not worry. &ldquo;Penny has good horse sense,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;And she was born with printer&rsquo;s ink in her
blood stream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The taxi stopped with a jerk in front of a large red
brick mansion. Large acreage was enclosed by a
wooden rail fence flanked by tall untrimmed bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I wait?&rdquo; inquired the cab driver as Penny
alighted.</p>
<p>She shook her head, started to pay him, then
thought of a better idea. &ldquo;Charge this to the <i>Star</i>,&rdquo;
she instructed.</p>
<p>The cab driver looked a trifle worried as if he were
fearful of losing the fare, so Penny flashed her press
card again. It worked like magic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, a charge it is,&rdquo; he agreed. He shifted gears
and drove away.</p>
<p>No sooner had Penny dismissed the cab than she
regretted it. Although she expected to catch a ride
with the <i>Star</i> photographer back to the paper, the
mansion had a deserted look. As she walked up the
gravel path, she noticed that many of the shades were
drawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one here,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wasted
my time coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Penny walked on to the front door
to ring the doorbell. Instead she found a brass
knocker in the shape of an ugly carved face. She
stared at it a moment, then let it fall against the brass
plate.</p>
<p>As Penny had feared, no one came to admit her.
She was turning away in defeat, when she fancied she
saw a shade move in one of the upstairs rooms. Encouraged,
she knocked again.</p>
<p>Still there was no answer, but distinctly she saw
the curtain flutter. Stepping back a pace, she gazed
upward.</p>
<p>A dark face was visible in a circular window of
one of the tower rooms. For a moment appraising
eyes focused upon her. Then the curtain jerked convulsively,
and the man was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">3</span>
<br /><i>A THATCHED ROOF COTTAGE</i></h2>
<p>Satisfied that the house was not deserted,
Penny hammered harder on the massive oaken door
with the brass knocker. Still no one came to admit
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone is here,&rdquo; she thought, intensely annoyed.
&ldquo;Well, if he can be stubborn, so can I! I&rsquo;ll make
such a nuisance of myself, they&rsquo;ll have to let me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hammered steadily with the knocker for a half
minute, then she experimented with pattern knocks,
in interesting combinations of dots and dashes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the window above her head flew open,
and the same dark-faced man peered angrily down at
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you want?&rdquo; he demanded in an unpleasant
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I should like to see Mrs. Rhett,&rdquo; Penny replied
politely. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s here, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she is, maybe she isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the sharp retort.
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>Resenting the man&rsquo;s unfriendly attitude, Penny
nevertheless answered that she was from the <i>Riverview
Star</i> and desired to interview Mrs. Rhett about
her missing husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam not seeing anyone. Go &rsquo;way now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The window slammed shut.</p>
<p>Convinced that the man, evidently a servant, had
acted upon instructions from Mrs. Rhett, Penny wondered
what to do. She considered returning to the
<i>Star</i> office to explain to Editor DeWitt.</p>
<p>But in Mr. DeWitt&rsquo;s dictionary there was no such
word as failure. He would cock an eyebrow at her,
growl: &ldquo;So you couldn&rsquo;t get in, eh?&rdquo; and promptly
send a more aggressive reporter to the mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could force my way in, but that&rsquo;s trespassing,&rdquo;
she reflected with deepening gloom. &ldquo;If I were
thrown into jail, Mr. DeWitt probably wouldn&rsquo;t even
bother to bail me out! He&rsquo;d say I didn&rsquo;t use my head
in an emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny decided to wait for the <i>Star</i> photographer,
who also had been sent out. In a tight pinch, photographers
nearly always could come up with a picture.
Between them they might think of a means of getting
into the mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Salt Sommers is sent here,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good scout. He&rsquo;ll help me get the story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Penny glanced hopefully toward the highway, but
the press car was not to be seen. With a sigh, she
slowly circled the house.</p>
<p>The building, no longer new, once had been one of
Riverview&rsquo;s finest homes. Now the red brick exterior
had become discolored, and trees and bushes
disclosed lack of skilled care. A hedge flanking the
walk had been trimmed unevenly. The lawn was
badly mowed, with many weeds going to seed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the estate was impressive, and Penny
walked along a sloping path to a pool of water lilies.
Seating herself on the cement rim, she dabbled her
hand in the water. A moment later, raising her eyes,
she caught a flash of color at one of the mansion windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m being watched,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Perhaps if I
poke around here long enough, Mrs. Rhett will decide
to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, there was no further movement at the
window, and presently Penny wandered around to
the rear of the house. Two interesting architectural
features drew her attention. At each side of the house
were circular tower rooms, each with two tiny round
windows which resembled human eyes.</p>
<p>From the rear of the mansion, several paths led in
diverse directions. One, which was weed-choked,
apparently angled toward the river beach. Years before,
when the Heights Yacht Club had been in operation,
many sailboats plied the waters at this particular
point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>Now, except for an occasional fisherman, few boats
ever came so far upstream. As the once fine neighborhood
had deteriorated, householders gradually had
moved away. Penny judged that the Rhetts, isolated
from their neighbors, probably were the only socially
prominent people remaining.</p>
<p>Selecting a path which led away from the river,
deeper into the grounds, Penny presently found herself
some distance from the road and the boundary
fences.</p>
<p>Hedging the cinder trail were high, untrimmed
bushes which completely screened her view. After
walking a short distance, she paused, uncertain
whether to keep on or return to the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This exploration isn&rsquo;t helping me get a story,&rdquo; she
reflected. &ldquo;If the <i>Star</i> photographer should come
while I&rsquo;m here, I might miss him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the trail had a fascination for Penny and
she was reluctant to turn back. In a tiny clearing a
short distance ahead, she saw what appeared to be a
thatched roof cottage. Only a moment or two would
be required to investigate it, she thought. Then she
would return to the road to await the photographer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>As Penny started eagerly on, she stubbed the toe of
her shoe on a stone, and nearly tripped. By quick
footwork, she saved herself a fall, but as she paused
to recover breath, she plainly saw the bushes at the
left hand side of the trail move convulsively. Only
a slight breeze had rippled the tree leaves.</p>
<p>Penny was certain that someone stood behind the
bush, watching her movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably it&rsquo;s that dark skinned man who called
to me from the window,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>The knowledge that she was a trespasser on the
Rhett property made Penny slightly uneasy. Likewise,
it was unnerving to know that her every move
was being watched. Admitting to herself that she
should turn back, she nevertheless kept on down the
path.</p>
<p>Without appearing to do so, she kept her eyes on
the bushes at the left hand side of the trail. Now and
then a slight jerk of the foliage convinced her that
the one who watched was following and keeping pace
with her.</p>
<p>Penny hastened her steps as she moved through a
cool, densely shaded woodland. Frost had tinted
many of the leaves with red and gold, but the arresting
beauty of the foliage was completely lost upon
her. She was only aware of those soft footsteps behind
her.</p>
<p>Then unexpectedly, Penny came to the clearing.
Scarcely seventy-five yards ahead, stood the thatched
roof cottage which had attracted her interest from
afar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>So quaint was the building that for a moment she
gave it her entire attention, forgetting the one who
watched from the bushes.</p>
<p>From where she stood, the cottage appeared to be
about the size of a large room, and resembled a native
hut. No windows were visible. The door was
closed, and across it was painted in black and red a
symbol which even from afar could be distinguished
as a serpent-like figure.</p>
<p>The cottage fascinated Penny. At first glance she
assumed it to be a large playhouse, but the serpent
painting convinced her the building never had been
intended for use of children.</p>
<p>A garden or tool house perhaps? She dismissed
the thought as quickly as it came. Into her mind
flashed a recollection of the drawing that had fallen
from Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s desk in the First National Bank.
The paper had borne a plumed serpent, apparently a
counterpart of the painting on the door of the
thatched roof cottage!</p>
<p>Forgetful of the person who crouched in the bushes,
Penny started eagerly forward, intending to examine
the strange drawing at close range. Something
whizzed past her, to embed itself in a tree trunk six
inches from her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Brought up short, she saw that it was an arrow
which had narrowly missed her. Had it been shot
from the bushes behind her, and by the person who
had stealthily followed her along the trail?</p>
<p>In cold fury, Penny jerked the arrow from the
tree. Only then did she notice a folded sheet of notebook
paper attached to it with a bit of string.
She broke the knot and freed the paper. Across
its crumbled face had been penciled a message. The
lead had smeared and the words were hard to read.
But she made them out.</p>
<p>The warning note said: &ldquo;Do not approach the
thatched roof cottage. To do so is to endanger your
life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">4</span>
<br /><i>BEHIND THE BUSHES</i></h2>
<p>Having read the warning message, Penny
whirled around to gaze toward the bushes on the left
side of the path. All now was still, with not the
slightest movement of leaves to reveal the presence of
the one who had shot the arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that man who talked so unpleasantly to me
from the mansion window!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Why, he
might have struck me with the arrow! I&rsquo;ll put an end
to his target practice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acting impulsively, she made a sudden dive for the
bushes, jerking them apart to expose the one who had
followed her. No one was there.</p>
<p>The grass, however, was trampled, and some distance
away, she heard a scurry of footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to get away!&rdquo; she thought grimly. &ldquo;Not
if I can prevent it! I&rsquo;ll have it out with him and learn
why he&rsquo;s warning me my life is endangered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The footsteps fast were dying away. Listening intently,
Penny decided that the person who had shot
the arrow was stealing through the bushes toward the
river path.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>Seeking the intersection of the two paths, the girl
stole noiselessly down the cindered trail sloping toward
the beach. She had guessed correctly. In a
moment she heard an agitation in the bushes nearby
and knew that the person she sought was struggling
through a tangle of underbrush.</p>
<p>Soon the bushes parted and a thin girl in blue shirt
and slacks stepped out onto the cindered path. In
one hand she carried an Indian bow with a quiver of
arrows, while with the other, she brushed dry leaves
from her long, dark hair.</p>
<p>Having expected to see a man, Penny was startled.
As she opened her lips to speak, the girl saw her and
was brought up short. She gasped in dismay, turned,
and with astonishing speed darted down the path leading
to the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; called Penny.</p>
<p>Keeping her face down, the girl raced on.</p>
<p>Determining that she should not escape without an
explanation, Penny gave chase. The runner had an
excellent start, but on coming to a series of wooden
steps, her heel caught in a small hole. Down she went,
and before she could arise, Penny had overtaken her.</p>
<p>Observing that the fall had not injured the girl, she
said sternly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now little Miss Robin Hood, will you kindly explain
why you tried to exterminate me with that arrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sitting up, the girl ruefully rubbed an ankle and
gazed at Penny with hostile brown eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous!&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I had no intention
of hitting you. My aim is perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Modest, at any rate,&rdquo; observed Penny, smiling
despite a determination to appear very stern. &ldquo;You
did write the warning note?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because in the first place, you have no business
being on our property. Secondly, I didn&rsquo;t want you to
go to the thatched roof cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Lorinda Rhett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hamilton Rhett&rsquo;s daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stepdaughter,&rdquo; the girl corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just the person I want to see!&rdquo; exclaimed
Penny, overjoyed at her good fortune. &ldquo;Your stepfather&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer no questions about him,&rdquo; the girl interrupted.
&ldquo;You may as well spare your breath.
Mother and I want no reporters here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you know who I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could one help knowing? You nearly broke
our door down with your pounding, and I heard you
talking to Ant&oacute;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your servant?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My stepfather&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Lorinda corrected with a slight
inflection which suggested that she did not entirely
approve of Ant&oacute;n. &ldquo;Now will you stop asking questions
and go away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in good time. First, I&rsquo;m relieved to know that
the thatched cottage isn&rsquo;t really dangerous. You only
wrote that to be rid of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda gave her a long, steady look but said not
a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or perhaps there is some mystery about the cottage,&rdquo;
Penny went on. &ldquo;After all, your stepfather&rsquo;s
disappearance was very queer. But the police, no
doubt, will get at the bottom of it when they come
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda scrambled to her feet. &ldquo;The police!&rdquo; she
gasped. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not have them here prying around!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether or not you like it, I&rsquo;m afraid you will have
the police on your doorstep. A man of Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s
prominence can&rsquo;t disappear without a few questions
being asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda lost much of her defiance. &ldquo;But this is
our own private affair,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;My stepfather
will return&mdash;at least, I think he will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the missing bonds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missing bonds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Albert Potts, the bank secretary, inform
your mother that $250,000 in negotiable securities
also had disappeared?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no! At least I knew nothing of it! Surely
you don&rsquo;t think my stepfather would stoop to the
theft of bank securities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no opinion in the matter. I&rsquo;m merely here
to get the true story. For some reason you and your
mother have been unwilling to cooperate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda did not reply, but seemed to be thinking
deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have any idea where your stepfather is
now?&rdquo; Penny inquired, hoping that a direct approach
might glean information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen him for the past ten days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; Lorinda acknowledged with great
reluctance. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not so unusual. My stepfather
frequently goes away on trips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without telling anyone where he is going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not answer that question,&rdquo; Lorinda said with
a proud uptilt of her chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you don&rsquo;t like reporters very well,&rdquo; observed
Penny pleasantly. &ldquo;Nor do you seem especially
fond of your stepfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true! I do like my stepfather. Why,
he was the one who taught me how to shoot with a
bow and arrow! He gave me this bow which is a
valuable collector&rsquo;s item!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She offered it to Penny who inspected the fine
workmanship with keen interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rhett is a collector?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s traveled all over the world, but most of
his time was spent in the jungles of Africa, Brazil, and
other places in South America. That was before he
married Mother, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your stepfather was especially interested in ancient
religious cults?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made a study of it, and for a year gathered
material by living in the jungle.&rdquo; Lorinda suddenly
broke off, aware that she was warming to Penny and
telling her entirely too much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was your father who built the thatched
roof cottage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, let&rsquo;s not talk about it,&rdquo; Lorinda pleaded.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to be unfriendly or impolite, but you
must understand there are things I can&rsquo;t tell you, and
which must never be published.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking the ancient bow from Penny&rsquo;s hand, the girl
started up the path, limping a trifle on her twisted
ankle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one more question, Lorinda. Please tell me
the truth. Why were you afraid to have me investigate
the thatched roof cottage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl paused on the path, gazing at Penny quite
pathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to tell you any more,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;The cottage is a place of evil omen. Truly, I did
you a favor in warning you away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a painting on the door&mdash;that of a winged or
plumed serpent. Will you explain its significance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only know that my stepfather had it painted
there when the cottage was built soon after his marriage
to my mother. It is a symbol of one of the ancient
cults he studied. Many of his trophies bear the
same picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The information was a little disappointing to
Penny. &ldquo;Then I suppose the drawing that the police
found in Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s office had no great significance,&rdquo;
she remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drawing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny described the serpent picture which had been
found, adding: &ldquo;On the sheet were written the words:
&lsquo;This shall be the end.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are certain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I saw the paper myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda was visibly disturbed. &ldquo;I must see that
writing! It may mean&mdash;&rdquo; she broke off and amended:
&ldquo;Tell me, where is the paper now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you seem to fear the police?&rdquo; inquired
Penny curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of them&mdash;certainly not. It&rsquo;s just
that Mother and I prefer to keep our lives private.
Facts can be so easily misinterpreted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your reluctance to assist the police also can be misinterpreted,&rdquo;
said Penny. &ldquo;For instance, it seems
strange to me that your stepfather&rsquo;s disappearance
doesn&rsquo;t seem to disturb you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it does! It&rsquo;s only&mdash;well, there are things I
can&rsquo;t tell you without my mother&rsquo;s permission. My
stepfather is queer. Mother and I never liked his interest
in weird cult practices. He had so many strange
acquaintances and ties with the past. We always
were afraid something dreadful might happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he may have met foul play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; Lorinda said miserably.
&ldquo;A ten-day disappearance is not so serious.
My stepfather occasionally went away before without
telling us, though never for such a long period.
If it weren&rsquo;t for the paper found in his desk, and the
missing bonds, I would say it&rsquo;s much ado about nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it is&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The loss of $250,000 could be a very serious matter.
Tell me, what is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here only to get a story for your paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was why I came, but since meeting you I
truthfully can say I also am very much interested in
helping you if possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you,&rdquo; Lorinda declared with a quick smile.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about the arrow. And I was very rude.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. I deliberately egged you on, hoping
you would tell me about your stepfather. I was sent
here to get a picture of him, and I hate to fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A picture? Mother has one, but I doubt that she
would permit you to use it.&rdquo; Lorinda considered a
moment, then added: &ldquo;Tell you what! I&rsquo;ll take you
to her, and perhaps, if you&rsquo;re a convincing talker,
she&rsquo;ll agree to your request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lorinda, that&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rhett girl linked arms with Penny as they
trudged up the path to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t count your chickens just yet,&rdquo; she warned.
&ldquo;Mother doesn&rsquo;t like reporters. It will be sheer luck
if she gives you the picture or any information you
can use in the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">5</span>
<br /><i>AN EVIL CHARM</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Mother has disliked reporters ever since she
married my stepfather, two years ago,&rdquo; Lorinda confided
as the girls approached the house. &ldquo;We were in
the Eastern part of the country at the time, and papers
played up the story, suggesting that Mr. Rhett
was a fortune hunter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he had no money of his own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a great deal. You see, my stepfather loved
travel, and until he met Mother he never really settled
down. He made a little by writing magazine articles,
and he spent it roving about the country and exploring
far corners of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been an interesting life,&rdquo; Penny commented
politely. &ldquo;Your mother enjoyed travel too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mercy no! One hardly can get her away
from Riverview. She and my stepfather never traveled
together after they were married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gathered that Mr. and Mrs. Rhett were entirely
different types of individuals, but she asked no
additional questions, for by this time, the girls had
reached the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Crossing a stone terrace at the rear of the dwelling,
they entered a spacious living room furnished with
elegant though formal furniture. Shades were partially
drawn, giving the interior a gloomy atmosphere,
despite the vases of brightly colored chrysanthemums
which decorated the tables.</p>
<p>A woman with dark hair tinged with gray sat reading
a book. She was immaculately groomed, every
curl of an elaborate hair-do in place, but her face
lacked tranquility. Her eyes were not on the page
before her, Penny noted, and as the two girls came in,
she visibly started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Lorinda,&rdquo; she murmured in relief.
&ldquo;I declare, I am getting jumpy! For a moment I
thought it might be the police or that inquisitive reporter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; interposed Lorinda hastily, &ldquo;allow me to
present Penny Parker, from the <i>Riverview Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rhett laid aside the book and stared at Penny,
her face without expression. Her voice was cold as
she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the <i>Star</i>? Lorinda, I am <i>very</i> sorry, but you
know my feeling in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny really is very nice, Mother,&rdquo; Lorinda said,
flashing her companion an encouraging smile. &ldquo;She
didn&rsquo;t want to come out here and question us about
father, but the editor sent her. He wants a picture,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Mrs. Rhett arose to terminate an interview which
had never really begun. &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; she repeated
with emphasis. &ldquo;There are to be no pictures taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The editor especially wanted a photograph of
your husband,&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;By publishing it in the
paper, it may be easier to trace him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Parker,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Rhett pleasantly but
with no warmth, &ldquo;if I need assistance in locating my
husband I shall request it. Meanwhile, I do wish
people would not concern themselves with our affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, we may not be able to avoid publicity,&rdquo;
Lorinda rushed on. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s likely to be a scandal.
You see, $250,000 in negotiable bonds disappeared
from the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment, Mrs. Rhett did not speak. A dagger-type
paper cutter lay on the polished table beside
her. Nervously her fingers closed upon it, and unaware
of the act, she jabbed the sharp point several
times through a lace doily centerpiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, you&rsquo;re ruining that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rhett dropped the paper cutter, which clattered
on the table and tumbled to the floor. Without
picking it up, she moved restlessly to the window,
only to return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What were you saying about $250,000 in bonds,
Lorinda?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Surely you didn&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only know what Penny told me. Soon after
Father disappeared, Albert Potts discovered the bonds
also were missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no connection. Why, even the suggestion
that my husband would steal is ridiculous!
It&rsquo;s preposterous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has accused your husband,&rdquo; Penny said
quietly. &ldquo;Perhaps the bonds will be found. Now
that the police have stepped into the case, there should
be developments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police,&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Rhett with a shiver.
&ldquo;Oh, dear, must we suffer their interference!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A telephone in an adjoining room rang and Lorinda
started to answer it. But her mother signalled to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it go, Lorinda. It may be the police now, or
another reporter. We&rsquo;ll have nothing to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone rang again. Footsteps were heard
down a hallway and a well-built, dark-skinned house-worker
of middle age padded into the room. She
gazed with intent curiosity at Penny as she started
toward the library to answer the phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, let it ring, Celeste,&rdquo; Mrs. Rhett directed.
&ldquo;And if anyone comes to the door asking for me, remember,
I am not at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; mumbled the housekeeper. She bent to
pick up the paper cutter from the floor and as she did
so an object which was tied about her neck with a
cord and kept hidden beneath her starched uniform,
swung into view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Penny obtained only a fleeting glimpse of the curious
article, for the woman hastily thrust it into her
dress front again. However, it appeared to be a tiny
packet of cloth.</p>
<p>Lorinda also had observed the object. Fixing the
woman with a stern gaze she said: &ldquo;Celeste, you&rsquo;re
wearing one of those heathenish <i>ouange</i> charms again!
You promised Mother you wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This only keeps away bad sickness,&rdquo; the woman
retorted, with a slight accent which nevertheless made
her words hard to understand. &ldquo;A good <i>ouange</i>.
Now that my master is away, you are not to tell me
what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorinda, don&rsquo;t plague her,&rdquo; Mrs. Rhett said
wearily. &ldquo;We have enough trouble as it is. Let her
wear the charm, or a dozen of them, if it gives her any
satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda subsided into injured silence, while Celeste
flashed a triumphant smile.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rhett turned again to Penny. In a tone which
could be interpreted only as a final dismissal she said:
&ldquo;I am sorry, Miss Parker, that I cannot help you. At
present I do not know my husband&rsquo;s whereabouts or
why he went away. If you will excuse me now, I
shall go to my room for a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>With dignity she crossed the living room to a handsome
circular stairway with a railing of polished
mahogany. Her head held proudly, she presented a
regal figure as she slowly climbed the steps.</p>
<p>But half way up, she suddenly halted, her body
jerking taut. Uttering a low cry which was almost
a scream, she stared at an object lying on the step in
front of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mother! What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; cried Lorinda.</p>
<p>With Penny and Celeste, she hastened to the staircase.
Mrs. Rhett&rsquo;s face was as colorless as if she had
seen a ghost. Her lips trembled. Without speaking,
she pointed to the stair carpet.</p>
<p>There at her feet lay two burnt match ends tied
together with a bit of scarlet string.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An <i>ouange</i>! An evil <i>ouange</i>!&rdquo; whispered Celeste
in horror.</p>
<p>Lorinda turned upon her angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste, don&rsquo;t say such things! You know how
nervous Mother is, and how easily she becomes upset!
If this is one of your charms&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; the woman protested. She stared
fixedly at the object on the floor. &ldquo;This charm is not
mine and it is not Ant&oacute;n&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how did it get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know. It is a sign of evil&mdash;a sign of
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Superstition!&rdquo; exclaimed Lorinda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Mrs. Rhett started on up the stairs, but as she would
have stepped over the burned matches, Celeste seized
her by the skirt, pulling her backwards. Frightened,
the woman screamed and fell heavily against the wall.</p>
<p>Celeste kept her from collapsing, all the while muttering
words Penny could not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that gibberish!&rdquo; Lorinda commanded.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rhett broke away from Celeste, and with an
hysterical cry, moved down the stairway and into the
library. Though she closed the door behind her, the
girls could hear her sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now see what you&rsquo;ve done!&rdquo; Lorinda accused
Celeste.</p>
<p>The woman paid no attention to her. Bending over
the match sticks, she swayed back and forth as she
muttered a strange chant. As Lorinda sought to pick
up the charm, Celeste struck her wrist a sharp blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Would you let your
mother die a slow and painful death? Do not touch
this thing of evil until I have finished! If she had
stepped over it, nothing would have saved her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celeste kept on with her mutterings until at last she
was through. &ldquo;I have done all I can,&rdquo; she said with a
deep sigh. Gingerly she picked up the match ends
and, dropping them into the living room fireplace,
saw them consumed by flame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now what is all this stupidity about Mother dying
a slow death?&rdquo; Lorinda demanded sternly. &ldquo;How did
that thing get into this house, and what does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How it came here I do not know,&rdquo; replied the
woman. &ldquo;Its meaning is simple. In the jungles such
symbols are sometimes placed on new graves, that the
departing spirit may kindle a little fire and warm its
cold hands in the other world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; interrupted Lorinda. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell
me any more. It&rsquo;s all so silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, true or false, Mother is not to be told such
nonsense. She&rsquo;s upset enough as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother already knows,&rdquo; said the housekeeper.
&ldquo;That is why she weeps. She fears that even
now the spell is upon her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste, you must be out of your mind!&rdquo; Lorinda
cried in exasperation. &ldquo;You never said such dreadful
things or acted like this when Father was here. What
has taken possession of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear for the family. It bodes ill that my master
should remain away. If only the Zudi drum were out
of the house&mdash;destroyed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda&rsquo;s patience had been overtaxed. &ldquo;The Zudi
drum!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, Celeste, you&rsquo;re impossible!
Go find Ant&oacute;n and if you must, talk such nonsense
to him! But not another word of it before us! Do
you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Celeste stood facing the two girls defiantly. Her
eyes burned with an angry fire, and Penny expected
her to make a bitter retort to Lorinda. Instead, she
seemed to withdraw into herself, and with downcast
head, scurried toward the kitchen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">6</span>
<br /><i>MATCHES AND STRING</i></h2>
<p>After Celeste had gone, Lorinda went quickly
to the library. Speaking soothingly to her mother, she
urged her to go upstairs and lie down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That dreadful thing on the steps!&rdquo; Mrs. Rhett
exclaimed with a shudder. &ldquo;Celeste jerked me back
to keep me from walking past it, didn&rsquo;t she? The
charm has an evil significance&mdash;perhaps that I shall
have a long lingering illness or die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know better than that, Mother. It&rsquo;s all superstitious
rot! What ever gave you such an idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t really know, Lorinda. I suppose
Hamilton told me about the charm long ago. When
I saw it on the step it gave me a deep shock and I
seemed to realize that it had been put there for me
alone to find. Lorinda, what if it should be a native
death charm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, I won&rsquo;t allow you to even think of such
foolishness! You&rsquo;re just upset because Father isn&rsquo;t
here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that must be it,&rdquo; Mrs. Rhett declared with a
heavy sigh. &ldquo;I have such a headache. I&rsquo;ll go to my
room now and try to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda took her arm and helped her up the stairway.
As they came to the step where the burnt
matches had been, Mrs. Rhett glanced down and
shivered. Then she laughed apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really is silly of me to let a little thing upset me
so,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be myself again as soon as I
have slept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After helping her mother into bed, Lorinda returned
to the living room where Penny had waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope you won&rsquo;t put any of this in the paper,&rdquo;
she began earnestly. &ldquo;People wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t myself,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;For instance,
what did Celeste mean when she spoke of the
Zudi drum? And who is she anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot to tell you! Celeste and her husband
Ant&oacute;n, are a couple my stepfather brought to this
country after spending a year studying ancient cult
practices. Celeste befriended him, I believe, and
helped him gain information about the tribesmen.
Anyway, Father took a fancy to her, and persuaded
the couple to come with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was before he married your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. After the wedding, my stepfather was
unwilling to let Celeste and Ant&oacute;n go, so Mother
agreed that they might work here. Ant&oacute;n is a worthless
servant. He allows the grounds to run down
shamefully, and the only time he ever really works
is when someone stands over him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Celeste?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she is a hard worker, but I confess I don&rsquo;t
understand her,&rdquo; Lorinda replied. &ldquo;We disliked each
other on sight. In a way, I&rsquo;m a little afraid of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain.&rdquo; Lorinda stirred restlessly. &ldquo;She
makes me feel uneasy whenever I am near her&mdash;almost
as if I were in the presence of Black Magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Penny&rsquo;s expression of astonishment, she amended
hastily: &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that exactly. Celeste is
devoted to my stepfather and I&rsquo;m sure only means to
be helpful. But the truth is, she&rsquo;s steeped in a mysterious
and not too wholesome past. Superstition is the
breath of life to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did the match ends get on the stairway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew.&rdquo; Lorinda&rsquo;s forehead wrinkled with
anxiety. &ldquo;Celeste may have told the truth when she
said neither she nor Ant&oacute;n had anything to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how was the charm brought into the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stepfather had enemies. Something tells me
all this may have a connection with the Zudi drum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Celeste suggest that idea to you? She
hinted that the drum&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;should be removed
from the house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can see myself getting rid of the Zudi drum!
Why, it is my stepfather&rsquo;s most prized trophy! He
took it from a native tribe, and as you might imagine,
there was plenty of trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your stepfather didn&rsquo;t steal the drum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, though tribesmen may have regarded
it that way. The drum was used in ceremonials and
was highly treasured by natives. Father tried to buy
it. When he couldn&rsquo;t, he left money and trinkets and
carried off the drum. Natives pursued him for more
than a hundred miles, but he got away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your stepfather has the drum now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we keep it in the library wall safe. Want to
see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to, if it&rsquo;s not too much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is I want to check to be certain the
drum is still here,&rdquo; Lorinda replied, leading the way
into the adjoining room. &ldquo;What Celeste said made
me uneasy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think your stepfather may have removed the
drum from the wall safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine him doing that. However, his
long absence is puzzling, and finding the burnt match
charm gives the whole situation a sinister slant. It&rsquo;s
barely possible some of those tribesmen followed him
here, hoping to recover the Zudi drum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that seems fantastic!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you understand tribal customs. From all
my stepfather told me of his experiences, I am sure
members of the Zudi cult would stop at nothing in trying
to recover their ceremonial drum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny inquired if Mr. Rhett ever had received
threats against his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dozens of them, but that was years ago. Since
he married Mother, I&rsquo;ve not heard of any. But then,
my stepfather was self-contained and rather strange
in many ways. If he had received threats, he might
not have told her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Becoming more interested in the story minute by
minute, Penny longed to ask if Mr. and Mrs. Rhett
ever had had serious disagreements. However, the
question was a difficult one, and she knew of no way
to phrase it without risking offense to Lorinda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never admit it to Celeste,&rdquo; the Rhett girl went
on, carefully drawing heavy draperies across the
arched doorway of the library and closing another
door which opened toward the stairs. &ldquo;But seeing
that match and string <i>ouange</i> gave me an unpleasant
moment. I&rsquo;m afraid my stepfather&rsquo;s enemies may
have picked up his trail. In that case&mdash;well, the charm
really could become an omen of evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re becoming morbid,&rdquo; laughed Penny.
&ldquo;What is there to fear in two burnt matches tied with
a string?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing perhaps,&rdquo; replied Lorinda, though without
firm conviction. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope the Zudi drum is
still here. I wish it had never been brought into the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A large painting of a Dutch windmill hung low on
the north library wall. To Penny&rsquo;s surprise, Lorinda
gave one of its long gold cords a jerk. The picture
swung back to disclose a cleverly hidden safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I hope I haven&rsquo;t forgotten the combination,&rdquo;
Lorinda murmured.</p>
<p>Thinking a moment, she whirled the dials with an
expert touch. The safe failed to open. With an
exclamation of annoyance, she tried again. This time
there was a sharp little click and as she turned the
handle, the circular door swung back.</p>
<p>Lorinda thrust her arm deep into the opening. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
here all right!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>From the safe she drew forth a bowl-shaped drum,
perhaps eight inches in diameter at the opening.
An animal skin was stretched over the framework and
the sides were decorated with symbols.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This probably is my stepfather&rsquo;s most valuable
trophy,&rdquo; Lorinda declared. &ldquo;He treasures it above
all else, because there is no other exactly like it. But
the drum never should have been taken from the
native tribe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>With her fingers, the girl tapped out a rhythm
on the drum. The first three notes were slow and
heavy, with a series of triplets coming as a light splutter
at the end.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">.  <span class="ws2">.</span>  <span class="ws2">.</span>  <span class="ws2">...</span>   <span class="ws3">.</span>  <span class="ws2">.</span>  <span class="ws2">.</span>  <span class="ws2">...</span></p>
<p class="t0">.  <span class="ws2">.</span>  <span class="ws2">.</span>  <span class="ws2">...</span>   <span class="ws3">.</span>  <span class="ws2">.</span>  <span class="ws2">.</span>  <span class="ws2">...</span></p>
</div>
<p>Penny, who had a keen sense of the ludicrous,
began to sway to the jungle rhythm. Lorinda
drummed with more energy, and they both burst into
laughter.</p>
<p>But suddenly for no apparent reason, the mirth died
from Lorinda&rsquo;s lips and abruptly she ended the tapping.</p>
<p>Tossing the Zudi drum into the wall safe, she closed
the heavy door and spun the dials. With another
swift movement, she swung the picture into place.</p>
<p>Penny started to speak, but a significant glance from
her companion served as a warning to remain silent.</p>
<p>Lorinda darted across the room, and jerked aside
the heavy brocade curtains which framed the arching
doorway. Crouching behind the protective folds
was the same dark-skinned servant who had talked to
Penny from the upstairs window!</p>

<br /><i>WHISPERING WALLS</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ant&oacute;n!&rdquo; Lorinda exclaimed in disapproval.
&ldquo;Why were you listening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant, a man of perhaps forty whose well-cut
livery was worn in a sloppy manner, stared at her almost
insolently and without the least embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear jungle drum,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was showing the Zudi to Miss Parker,&rdquo; Lorinda
replied stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep him in wall safe?&rdquo; inquired Ant&oacute;n.</p>
<p>Lorinda bit her lip with annoyance. She made no
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that master gone, maybe much better you
get rid of Zudi drum,&rdquo; Ant&oacute;n advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zudi drum bring trouble. Ant&oacute;n tell master so
when he bring it to this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you suggest we do with the drum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ant&oacute;n take care of it,&rdquo; the servant offered eagerly.
&ldquo;Sink it deep in river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Lorinda smiled and shook her head. &ldquo;The Zudi
drum is my stepfather&rsquo;s most cherished possession.
He never would forgive me if I disposed of it while
he&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe master never come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ant&oacute;n!&rdquo; Lorinda reproved. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to make
such remarks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; the man muttered, but as he retreated
from the library doorway Penny fancied she saw him
smile as if well pleased with himself.</p>
<p>After the servant had gone, Lorinda remarked in
a whisper: &ldquo;I wish he hadn&rsquo;t seen me put the drum
away. Somehow I&rsquo;ve never trusted Ant&oacute;n although
he&rsquo;s always been devoted to my stepfather. Sometimes
I feel that he hates me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say he didn&rsquo;t know until just now where the
drum was kept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he may have suspected, but he never was
certain. Ant&oacute;n always has been deeply interested in
that drum, which as I understand, belonged to another
tribe&mdash;sworn enemies of Ant&oacute;n&rsquo;s group. He and
Celeste helped my stepfather obtain the drum, or
rather they told him about its existence, so I suppose
it&rsquo;s natural that they remain interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ant&oacute;n seemed to believe the drum might bring
trouble on the household.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just stupid superstition! He&rsquo;s never worried about
it before.&rdquo; Lorinda was thoughtful a moment, then
added: &ldquo;Of course, there is a possibility members of
the Zudi tribe may have traced my stepfather here
and intend to avenge themselves. But that hardly
seems likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of the serpent drawing found in your stepfather&rsquo;s
desk?&rdquo; Penny reminded her. &ldquo;And the words,
&lsquo;This Shall be the End?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d not venture an opinion until I have seen the
handwriting,&rdquo; Lorinda returned.</p>
<p>As the girls were leaving the library, Penny heard
an automobile rattle up to the front of the mansion.
Peering from a window, she saw Salt Sommers climbing
out of the car, camera and flashbulbs in his hand.</p>
<p>His arrival reminded her that she was here to get a
story for the <i>Star</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police aren&rsquo;t here?&rdquo; Lorinda inquired tensely,
moving to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s one of our photographers. He&rsquo;ll need a
picture of you and your mother. It will only take a
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda, who had been growing more and more
friendly, now became cold and aloof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No picture,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;I thought you understood.
My mother and I wish no publicity whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I must ask you to leave now,&rdquo; Lorinda
said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Deeply chagrined by her failure to obtain a picture,
Penny followed the Rhett girl to the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Lorinda said, observing the proud tilt
of Penny&rsquo;s chin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing personal. I really like
you very much and would like to help you&mdash;but I
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened the door and Penny went out. As the
latch clicked behind her, Salt, a tall young man with
an aggressive walk, came toward the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Penny!&rdquo; he greeted her casually. &ldquo;Sorry to be
late, but I got tied up in a traffic jam at Fulton Bridge.
Everything lined up for the pictures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny told him the bad news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now see here, they can&rsquo;t do that to us,&rdquo; Salt said,
knocking on the door of the old mansion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll catch
the dickens from DeWitt if I go back to the office
without a picture. How about the story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much we can use. I talked to Mrs. Rhett and
her daughter, but they didn&rsquo;t give me any real information.
Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s disappearance seems to be as
puzzling to them as anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can hook your story onto that angle then.
But me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to come up with a picture.&rdquo; Salt
knocked again on the door. &ldquo;Say, are they all deaf in
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;I doubt if anyone will
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>Salt pounded a few more times, and then was forced
to admit that he was only wasting his energy. &ldquo;I
might take a shot of the house,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Gloomy
old morgue, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about all you can do under the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A picture of a house,&rdquo; Salt groaned. &ldquo;DeWitt&rsquo;ll
go for it like a ton o&rsquo; brick. He&rsquo;ll probably throw a
typewriter at me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another place on the grounds that might
be more interesting. It&rsquo;s a sort of thatched roof cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt immediately brightened. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look-see,&rdquo;
he proposed. &ldquo;Maybe we can round up a
gardener or someone who&rsquo;ll pose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Circling the house, Penny led the way down the
graveled path. Salt took such long strides it was hard
to keep up with him. He&rsquo;d had a tough day, he told
her. As if taking shots of society women at the Country
Club hadn&rsquo;t been bad enough, right on top of it
he&rsquo;d been sent to the airport to catch a couple of
prominent state officials. And then, before he&rsquo;d had
a chance to get the pictures printed, DeWitt had ordered
him to the mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just one thing after another,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I
wish someone would tell me why I don&rsquo;t quit newspaper
photography.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because, no matter what you say, you like the
excitement,&rdquo; Penny supplied. &ldquo;Remember those shots
you took of the Governor that were printed in the
rotogravure section?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; grinned Salt, his good humor returning.
&ldquo;I also remember the time I was sent to a furniture
store to take some pictures for the advertising department,
and without me knowing it, the store closed for
the night. I telephoned DeWitt I was locked in, and
what did the old crow do? &lsquo;Just sit down and wait,&rsquo;
he says. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get hold of a watchman, and we&rsquo;ll have
you right out of there.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had heard the story several times but did not
ruin the photographer&rsquo;s pleasure by saying so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DeWitt didn&rsquo;t do a doggone thing!&rdquo; Salt went on.
&ldquo;He just told everyone in the office. I cooled my
heels in that place until nine o&rsquo;clock at night! A fire
broke out across town then, and DeWitt needed another
photographer, so finally he got me out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. DeWitt has a queer sense of humor,&rdquo; Penny
acknowledged. &ldquo;But he is a good editor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best there is,&rdquo; Salt agreed loyally. &ldquo;But wow!
He&rsquo;s going to tear me apart limb from limb when I
come in with nothing but a picture of a thatched roof
cottage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was tempted to tell the photographer of
Lorinda&rsquo;s strange action in warning her not to approach
the building. However, she felt sure he
would make light of the entire matter, so she remained
silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the place?&rdquo; Glimpsing the thatched roof
cottage through the trees, Salt paused to stare at it.
&ldquo;Looks like a jungle hut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A reproduction of one, I imagine,&rdquo; Penny said,
&ldquo;but it might be the genuine product. Mr. Rhett, I&rsquo;ve
been told, was a world traveler and brought home
many relics and souvenirs of jungle and cult life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They approached closer and Salt stopped again, this
time to take two shots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s inside?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was curious to see the interior of the cottage
despite Lorinda&rsquo;s warning. However, as she trotted
along at Salt&rsquo;s heels, she experienced a strange, uneasy
feeling, as if she were intruding upon forbidden
ground.</p>
<p>The photographer was troubled by no such misgivings.
Boldly he went to the door and tried to
thrust it open. It was locked and would not budge.</p>
<p>Thwarted, he examined the painted plumed serpent
which decorated the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this thing?&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Penny told him about the similar design which had
been found on a paper in Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a close-up of the door then,&rdquo; Salt decided.
&ldquo;It will tie in with your story, if you build up the
mystery angle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>While the photographer took two pictures of the
door, Penny wandered around to the back of the tiny
cottage. Only one small window provided light. It
had been cut in the wall high toward the sloping
thatched roof, and to peer into the dark interior,
Penny had to stand on tiptoe.</p>
<p>Inside the room, a spot of light and flame drew her
gaze. And at the same instant, something jabbed her
ribs from behind. With a startled cry, she whirled
around.</p>
<p>Then she laughed, for it was Salt who had come up
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You frightened me out of a year&rsquo;s growth!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever do that again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see? Anything interesting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if a lamp is burning inside. But the cottage
must be deserted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt peeped through the window. &ldquo;It is a light&mdash;an
oil flame!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no one in the
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; said Penny with a shiver. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting
late and we&rsquo;re due back at the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not scared, are you?&rdquo; the photographer teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not! But the door is locked, and we&rsquo;re
not supposed to be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt tested the window. Surprisingly, it raised
easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll boost you in,&rdquo; he offered. &ldquo;Up you go!
Then you can unlock the door and let me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Salt, should we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;We were sent to get a
story and pictures, weren&rsquo;t we? Well, maybe what
we&rsquo;re after is right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only half convinced, Penny permitted herself to
be boosted through the window. She dropped lightly
onto a wooden floor. The interior of the cottage was
gloomy, brightened only by a flickering flame which
came from a floating wick in a cocoanut shell filled
with oil.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the room, was sombre, almost
terrifying. Taking no time to look about, Penny
scurried to unlock the door. She felt more at ease as
Salt sauntered in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is a queer layout,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;A
regular jungle hut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room was bare of furniture except for a low
wooden table upon which the cocoanut oil lamp
burned. On one wall hung two black and red flags
with serpentine symbols sewn with metallic beads.</p>
<p>Across the room, above the deep fireplace, two
crossed machetes dangled from cords attached to the
wall. Beneath the table was a small, crude wooden
chest, and lying upon it was a rattle made from pebbles
placed in a painted canister.</p>
<p>Salt shook the rattle several times. In the stillness
of the room, the clatter of the pebbles seemed almost
deafening to Penny&rsquo;s sensitive ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please!&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo; he teased.</p>
<p>Penny shook her head. With fascinated gaze, she
stared at the flickering oil light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose that thing burns all the time, Salt,
or has someone just been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t burn very long, unless someone keeps
refilling the shell with oil. Wonder what&rsquo;s in this
chest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt stooped to raise the lid. As he did so, Penny,
who stood close beside him, suddenly clutched his
arm. At his look of surprise, she mumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard something just then&mdash;like the
rustling of silk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt listened a moment and chuckled. &ldquo;That old
imagination of yours is working overtime, Penny!
Relax!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I did hear a rustling sound as if someone were
moving along the wall. Listen! There it is again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one could&mdash;&rdquo; Salt began, and broke off. The
queer look that came over his face told Penny that
he too had heard the sound.</p>
<p>Then whispering began, and seemed to issue from
the very cottage walls. At first the stunned pair could
not distinguish a word. But gradually the words
whispered in a throaty voice became audible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; the warning voice commanded. &ldquo;All is forbidden!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">8</span>
<br /><i>GHOST OF THE DARK CORNERS</i></h2>
<p>Salt was the first to recover from surprise at
the whispered warning. Convinced that someone
must be crouching beneath the open cottage window,
he strode across the room to peer outside.</p>
<p>No one was in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The voice seemed to come from the wall itself!&rdquo;
Penny murmured. She added jokingly, &ldquo;Maybe this
place has a ghost who is annoyed because we climbed
in through the window!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That whispered warning came from a very human
ghost,&rdquo; the photographer muttered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do a little
annoying ourselves if we can find the bird!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt jerked open the door. Penny followed him
outside. Behind them, the door swung shut again,
but neither noticed.</p>
<p>Quickly they circled the cottage. No one was
visible in the clearing nor were leaves stirring in the
bushes close by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Salt, however, remained convinced the warning
had been whispered by someone standing close to the
window who then had quickly retreated to the sheltering
shrubbery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The warning seemed to come from the very inside
of the walls,&rdquo; Penny repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could it? The walls are only average thickness,
so the only place a person could hide would be
outside. It&rsquo;s a cinch no one was in the room with
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorinda might have crept close to the cottage and
whispered the warning,&rdquo; Penny said thoughtfully,
&ldquo;but I doubt it very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorinda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Rhett&rsquo;s daughter. She tried to prevent me
investigating the cottage before you arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she may have followed us here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whispering voice didn&rsquo;t sound like hers,&rdquo;
Penny insisted. &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t believe it was Lorinda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt started back toward the cottage. &ldquo;Whoever it
was, let&rsquo;s not be bluffed out, Penny. We&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s
inside the wooden chest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cottage door was closed. To the photographer&rsquo;s
annoyance, it refused to open even when he
thrust his weight against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Did you close the
door when you came out, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I recall. The wind must have blown it
shut.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wind? What wind? Look at the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely a leaf was stirring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m afraid it must have been the jungle
ghost,&rdquo; Penny said with a nervous giggle. She glanced
at her wrist watch. &ldquo;Salt, it&rsquo;s getting late. We
must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; retorted Salt grimly.</p>
<p>Again he circled the thatched cottage, with Penny
tagging none too happily at his heels. As they saw
the window, they both paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s closed now!&rdquo; Penny gasped. &ldquo;How did
we leave it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open. The cottage door may have blown shut
by itself and locked with a spring catch, but this
window is a horse of a different color. It couldn&rsquo;t
have closed by itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could have lowered it? How was it done
without our knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt had no explanation. Lifting Penny so that she
could peer inside the room again, he asked her what
she could see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a sign of anyone. But it&rsquo;s so dark&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See anything now?&rdquo; Salt demanded impatiently as
her voice trailed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cocoanut shell lamp! It&rsquo;s no longer burning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see better if I wore bifocals! The room
is dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;An experience like this shouldn&rsquo;t happen to a dog,&rdquo;
muttered Salt. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out what&rsquo;s behind it!
Raise the window and in we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny tugged at the sill. &ldquo;Locked,&rdquo; she reported.
&ldquo;From the inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disgusted, Salt allowed her to drop lightly to the
ground. &ldquo;Wait until I find a rock,&rdquo; he instructed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny caught his arm. &ldquo;No, Salt! We&rsquo;ve already
overstepped our rights. We mustn&rsquo;t damage the
Rhett property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, someone is making a monkey of us,&rdquo; the
photographer grumbled. &ldquo;It burns me up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to it than meets the eyes, Salt. Even
the atmosphere of this place is sinister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that, and yet you&rsquo;re willing to turn your
back on an unsolved mystery? How times have
changed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Penny wavered, for it was true she loved
mystery and adventure. But she finished in a firm
voice: &ldquo;We were sent here to get a story and picture
for the <i>Star</i>! We&rsquo;ll miss the Green Streak edition if
we don&rsquo;t get back to the office <i>pronto</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thrust her wrist watch beneath Salt&rsquo;s nose. He
looked at the moving hands and muttered: &ldquo;Jeepers!
We&rsquo;ve got just thirty-five minutes to catch our deadline!
Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Hurriedly, they went up the path toward the
mansion and the road. As they approached the house,
the rear door swung open and Lorinda came out on
the flagstone terrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is now!&rdquo; Penny murmured in an undertone.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she could have been the one
who whispered the warning at the cottage! It must
have been someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she the Rhett girl?&rdquo; Salt demanded, starting to
adjust his camera. &ldquo;Maybe I can get a shot of her
after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda came directly toward the pair, but she
raised a hand squarely in front of her face as she saw
that Salt meant to take her picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pose. I only
came to ask you to leave. Mother is so upset. The
telephone is ringing constantly, and we expect the
police any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda obviously was on the verge of tears. Salt
lowered his camera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do want to help you,&rdquo; Lorinda hastened on.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I am giving you this. Mother doesn&rsquo;t
know about it, and she will be furious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into Penny&rsquo;s hand, she thrust a small but clear
photograph of a middle-aged man who wore glasses.
His left cheek was marred by a jagged though not
particularly disfiguring scar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your stepfather!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is the only picture we have of him. He
never liked to have his photograph taken. If you use
it, please take good care of the original and see that
we get it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we will!&rdquo; Penny promised. &ldquo;This photograph
should help in tracing Mr. Rhett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please go now,&rdquo; Lorinda urged again. She glanced
uneasily down the path toward the thatched-roof cottage,
but if she knew what had transpired there, she
gave no sign.</p>
<p>Elated to have obtained the photograph, Penny and
Salt hastened on to the parked press car. Starting the
car with a jerk, Salt followed the winding river road.</p>
<p>Penny cast a glance over her shoulder. Through
the trees she could see only the roof-top of the
thatched cottage in the clearing.</p>
<p>The estate was bounded by a wooden rail fence, in
many places fortified with dense, tall shrubbery. The
fall weather had tinted many of the bushes scarlet, yellow
or bronze. Gazing toward a patch of particularly
brilliant-colored leaves, Penny detected movement
behind them.</p>
<p>For a fleeting instant she thought she had seen a
large, shaggy dog. Then she became certain it was a
man who crouched behind the screen of leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt!&rdquo; she exclaimed sharply. &ldquo;Look at those
bushes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The photographer slowed the car, turning his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about &rsquo;em, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Someone is hiding there behind the fence! Perhaps
it&rsquo;s the person who whispered a warning at the
thatched cottage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s just a shadow,&rdquo; Salt began, only to change
his mind. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right! Someone is crouching
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So suddenly that Penny was thrown sideways, the
photographer swerved the car to the curb. He swung
the door open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; Penny demanded.</p>
<p>The photographer did not take time to reply.
Already he was out of the car, running toward the
hedge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">9</span>
<br /><i>JERRY ENTERS THE CASE</i></h2>
<p>As Salt ran toward him, the man who crouched
behind the bushes began to move stealthily away.
From the car Penny could not see his face which was
screened by dense foliage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt, he&rsquo;s getting away!&rdquo; she shouted.</p>
<p>Salt climbed over the fence. His clothing got
snagged and by the time he had freed himself and
struggled through a tangle of vines and bushes, the
man he pursued had completely disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way did he go, Penny?&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lost sight of him after he ducked into a clump of
shrubbery,&rdquo; she replied regretfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless to
try to find him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt came back to the car, and starting the engine,
drove on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see who it was?&rdquo; Penny asked hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think it was a man. Maybe the Rhett&rsquo;s
gardener or a tramp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever it was, I&rsquo;m sure he stood there watching
us drive away from the grounds,&rdquo; Penny declared.</p>
<p>Until the car was far down the street, she alertly
watched the Rhett grounds. However, the one who
had crouched by the fence now was well hidden and
on guard. Not a movement of the bushes betrayed his
presence.</p>
<p>As the Rhett mansion was lost completely from
view, Penny&rsquo;s thoughts came back to the story which
she must write. Nervously she glanced at her wrist
watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the bad news?&rdquo; Salt asked, stepping hard
on the gasoline pedal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five minutes until deadline. Can you
make it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt&rsquo;s lips compressed into a grim line and he concentrated
on his driving, avoiding heavy traffic and
red lights as they approached the center of town.</p>
<p>They came at last to the big stone building downtown
which housed the <i>Riverview Star</i>. As Salt
pulled up at the curb, Penny leaped out and ran inside.
Without waiting for an elevator, she darted up the
stairs to the busy newsroom.</p>
<p>Editor DeWitt was talking on a telephone, and, all
about him, reporters were tapping typewriters at a
furious pace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Editor DeWitt held his hand over the phone mouthpiece
and fixed Penny with a gloomy eye. &ldquo;Time
you got here,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Anything new? Did
you get the pictures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny produced the photograph of Mr. Rhett
which the editor studied an instant, then tossed to his
assistant, with a terse: &ldquo;Make it a one column&mdash;rush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing that with a deadline practically at hand
Mr. DeWitt was in no mood for a lengthy tale, Penny
told him only such facts as were pertinent to Mr.
Rhett&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the family won&rsquo;t talk?&rdquo; DeWitt growled.
&ldquo;Well, play up that angle. We&rsquo;ve already set up
everything you gave us over the phone. Make this
an add and get it right out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded and slid into a chair behind the
nearest typewriter. An &ldquo;add&rdquo; she knew, was an addition
to a story already set up in type. It was easier to
write than a &ldquo;lead&rdquo; which contained the main facts
of all that had happened, but even so, she would be
hard pressed to make the deadline.</p>
<p>For a moment she concentrated, but the noises of
the room distracted her somewhat. Editor DeWitt
was barking into the telephone again; a reporter on her
left side was clicking a pencil against the desk; the
short-wave radio blared a police call; and across the
room someone bellowed: &ldquo;Copy boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Penny began to write, and the noises blanked
out, until she was aware only of the moving ribbon of
words on the copy paper. She had written perhaps
four paragraphs when DeWitt ordered tersely: &ldquo;Give
me a take.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Without looking up, Penny nodded, wrote a few
more words, then jerked the copy from her machine.
A boy snatched it from her hand and carried it to
DeWitt, who read it rapidly. Pencilling a few minor
corrections, he shot it to the copy desk.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with another sheet of paper rolled in
her machine, Penny was grinding out more of the
story. Words flowed easily now, and she scarcely
paused to think.</p>
<p>DeWitt called for more copy. Again she ripped it
from the roller and gave it to the boy.</p>
<p>After the third &ldquo;take,&rdquo; DeWitt called: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
enough. Make her &lsquo;30.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny understood the term. It signified the end of
the story, and usually when reporters had completed
an article, they wrote the figure at the bottom of the
copy sheet.</p>
<p>Finishing the sentence she had started, she gave the
last of her story to the boy, and settling back, took a
deep breath. DeWitt&rsquo;s chair was empty. He had
gone to the composing room, leaving his assistant to
handle the final copy that came through before the
presses rolled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Penny knew that the last page she had written
probably would not make the edition, but it did not
matter. She had crammed all the important and most
interesting of her information into the first part of the
story. In any event, everything she had written
would be used in the second edition, the Three Star,
which followed the Green Streak by two hours. The
final edition rolled from the presses later in the evening
and was known as the Blue Streak.</p>
<p>A well-built, good looking reporter with a pencil
tucked behind one ear, walked over to the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big day, Penny?&rdquo; he inquired affectionately.</p>
<p>Jerry Livingston, who rated as the <i>Star&rsquo;s</i> best reporter,
also stood at the very top of Penny&rsquo;s long list
of friends.</p>
<p>With Jerry, Penny always felt comfortable and at
ease. Now she found herself telling him about the
Rhett case, omitting few details of what had occurred
in the thatched roof cottage. It took longer to relate
all the events than Penny realized, for, before she had
finished the story, the Green Streak edition was up,
and a boy was distributing papers about the office.
Penny reached eagerly for one, noting instantly that
her article appeared in good position on the front
page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder who wrote the lead?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You,
Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Any mistakes?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Penny could find none. It was a perfect rewrite,
based upon facts she had telephoned to the office after
leaving the bank. The story had a professional swing
she could not have achieved. Her own &ldquo;add&rdquo; went
into it very smoothly, however, so that few persons
reading the account ever would guess two reporters
had contributed to the writing.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWitt had returned from the composing
room, and with a relaxed air settled down to enjoy a
cigarette. Now that the edition was rolling off the
press, he no longer seemed nervous or irritable.</p>
<p>Presently he waved his hand toward Penny who
went over to see what he wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Rhett story is likely to develop into something,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll want double coverage, so I&rsquo;m assigning
Jerry to help you. He&rsquo;ll handle the police
angle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded, secretly glad it was Jerry who had
been directed to help her instead of another reporter.
Police work, particularly the checking of routine reports,
was vitally important but uninteresting. She
was pleased to escape it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to keep close tab on the Rhett mansion,&rdquo;
Mr. DeWitt instructed. &ldquo;Report everything of consequence
that happens there. By tomorrow things
may start popping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wire editor came swiftly to DeWitt&rsquo;s desk with
a sheet of copy which had just been torn from an Associated
Press teletype.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A few hours ago
police published for all state banks the numbers of
those bonds stolen from the First National Bank. According
to this Culver City dispatch, one of the bonds,
in $1,000 denomination, turned up there yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday?&rdquo; Penny inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, a Culver City bank took the bond in, not
knowing it was one of the missing ones. Late this
afternoon, police sent out the numbers to every bank
in the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DeWitt read the news item carefully his eyes
glinting with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad Albert Potts didn&rsquo;t notify the police several
days ago. Rhett may be half way to the Mexican
border by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you believe he walked off with the bonds?&rdquo;
asked Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it,&rdquo; shrugged the editor. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
other suspect. Or if there is, the police aren&rsquo;t talking.
More of those missing bonds may show up. Jerry,
get busy on the telephone!&rdquo; he called to the reporter
who sat nearby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo; Jerry inquired, getting up and
coming to the desk.</p>
<p>DeWitt thrust the dispatch into his hand. &ldquo;Get
hold of that Culver City banker,&rdquo; he instructed.
&ldquo;Find out who turned the bond in, and if the description
fits Rhett.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Jerry was occupied at the telephone for nearly
fifteen minutes. He returned to report: &ldquo;The bond
was turned in by a woman, and the bank clerk didn&rsquo;t
make a record of her name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any description?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the clerk only remembers that she was a middle-aged
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DeWitt sighed heavily and turned his attention to
other matters. Penny glanced at the clock. It was
after six o&rsquo;clock. Her father, she knew, would have
left the office nearly an hour earlier. She could catch
a bus home, but first a cup of coffee across the street
might help to fortify her until she could enjoy a home-cooked
dinner by Mrs. Weems.</p>
<p>As she started away from the office, Jerry followed
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going across the way for a bite to eat?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Mind if I tag along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would,&rdquo; she replied eagerly. &ldquo;We can
talk about the Rhett case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s bury that until tomorrow. I&rsquo;d rather
talk about a dozen other subjects&mdash;you, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that little curl behind your ear. Or the
smudge of carbon on the end of your nose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me before?&rdquo; Indignantly,
Penny peered at her reflection in a hand mirror
and rubbed vigorously with her handkerchief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Outside the <i>Star</i> building, newsboys were shouting
their wares. As Penny and Jerry started to cross the
street, one of the lads who had received a job through
the girl&rsquo;s influence, spied the pair.</p>
<p>Approaching, he flashed a paper in front of their
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See this bird who robbed the bank!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
pointing to the picture of Hamilton Rhett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy, I&rsquo;m afraid your reading is inaccurate,&rdquo;
Penny laughed. &ldquo;The story doesn&rsquo;t say Mr. Rhett
robbed a bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have done it,&rdquo; the newsboy insisted.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the reward for his capture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rhett is not listed as a criminal,&rdquo; Penny explained.
&ldquo;There is no reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy&rsquo;s face dropped an inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, son?&rdquo; asked Jerry. &ldquo;Figuring
on cashing in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sort of,&rdquo; the boy admitted. &ldquo;I saw the fellow
not an hour ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t robbing another bank?&rdquo; Jerry teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was going into a house on Fulton Street. I
didn&rsquo;t take down the number &rsquo;cause when I saw him I
didn&rsquo;t think nothin&rsquo; of it. The Green Streak wasn&rsquo;t
out then, and I hadn&rsquo;t seen his picture in the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fulton Street?&rdquo; repeated Penny, frowning.
&ldquo;What section?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was at the corner of Fulton and Cherry. He
went into an old three-story brick building with a
sign: &lsquo;Rooms for rent&mdash;beds thirty cents.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Tommy means Riverview&rsquo;s cheapest flop
house!&rdquo; Jerry exclaimed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine a bank
president luxuriating in a Fulton Street dump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, I saw him. He wore old clothes, but
it was the same bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy, you&rsquo;ll grow up to be a police detective
some day,&rdquo; Jerry chuckled. He started to pull Penny
along, but she held back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Jerry, if there should be anything to it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry smiled indulgently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us more about the man you saw,&rdquo; Penny
urged Tommy. &ldquo;How was he dressed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wore old clothes and a floppy black hat. And
there was a scar on his cheek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry, Mr. Rhett had a similar scar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so have dozens of other people. Did I ever
show you the one I got when I was a kid? Another
boy socked me with a bottle and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be serious, Jerry! Tommy, are you sure the man
you saw looked like the picture in the paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross my heart and hope to die. It was the spitten
image! If you catch him, will you give me a reward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll split fifty-fifty,&rdquo; grinned Jerry, pulling
Penny on by brute force.</p>
<p>But across the street he met unexpected opposition.
Stopping dead in her tracks, Penny announced: &ldquo;This
is where we part company. I&rsquo;m going to investigate
that place on Fulton Street!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, are you crazy? You can&rsquo;t go to a flop house
alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I shall do, unless you come
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a waste of time! You know these kids.
Tommy read the story, and it fired his imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; admitted Penny, unmoved. &ldquo;All the
same, I&rsquo;m going there to make certain. How about
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry looked longingly at the restaurant and drew
a deep sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he gave in, &ldquo;I learned years ago that it&rsquo;s no
use arguing with a gal. Lead on, but don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t
warn you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">10</span>
<br /><i>CHEAP LODGING</i></h2>
<p>Street lights blinked on as Penny and Jerry
reached the corner of Fulton and Cherry Streets, in
the poorer section of Riverview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be the building,&rdquo; the reporter said, indicating
an old, discolored brick building with a faded
sign which proclaimed it a cheap rooming house of
the type patronized by those who could afford only a
few cents for a bed.</p>
<p>They crossed the street. Penny&rsquo;s courage faltered
as she saw that they must climb a long, dark stairway.
Dust was very thick; the air inside was stuffy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still can change your mind, you know,&rdquo; said
Jerry. &ldquo;Why not wait outside, while I go up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook her head.</p>
<p>Climbing the stairs, they entered an open space from
which branched narrow corridors. The landing was
even dirtier and darker than the stairway, with a huge
pasteboard carton standing in a corner filled with
empty bottles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>In a little office room, behind a cage window, sat
a plump middle-aged woman with reddish frizzled
hair. She eyed the pair suspiciously. To her experienced
eye, their manner and clothing immediately
stamped them as &ldquo;outsiders,&rdquo; perhaps investigators.
She smiled ingratiatingly at Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for a man,&rdquo; he said briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re from the police, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;We got nothin&rsquo; to hide. My husband and me run a
respectable place for poor workin&rsquo; men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we see your room register?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Ever since that last copper was here I been
keepin&rsquo; it just like he told me I had to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the wooden slats of the cage, the woman
thrust a grimy notebook which had been ruled off to
provide spaces for names, addresses and date of registry.</p>
<p>Rapidly Jerry scanned the entries for several days
back. No one by the name of Rhett had registered,
but neither he nor Penny had expected the banker
would be stupid enough to use his real name, if indeed
he had come to such a place.</p>
<p>As Penny glanced about the dingy, smoke-stained
room, it seemed impossible to her that Mr. Rhett, a
man of culture and wealth, would voluntarily seek
such quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The man we&rsquo;re looking for is middle-aged,&rdquo;
Penny explained. &ldquo;He wore glasses and may have
been well dressed. We were told he was seen here
earlier tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all look alike to me,&rdquo; the woman said wearily.
&ldquo;Most of my rooms are empty now. We don&rsquo;t fill
up until the coppers start runnin&rsquo; loiterers off Cherry
Street around ten o&rsquo;clock. It&rsquo;s still warm enough outside
so&rsquo;s a lot o&rsquo; the cheap skates can sleep out on the
river bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t anyone here?&rdquo; inquired Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe one or two men. A fella name of Ben
Smith came in about an hour or two ago. He signed
up for one of the flops. Come to think of it, maybe
he&rsquo;s the one you&rsquo;re after. He acted nervous like and
I figured maybe he was dodgin&rsquo; the police. Another
thing, he acted like he was used to havin&rsquo; money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he have much on him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see, but he paid me with a five dollar bill.
And why would a fella with even that much dough
sleep in a flop if he wasn&rsquo;t tryin&rsquo; to dodge the cops?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you describe the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was about average height and middle-aged.
No glasses, though. He couldn&rsquo;t have been down and
out very long, because he still wore a ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Describe it, please,&rdquo; requested Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a gold ring with a picture of a snake on it&mdash;some
sort of order probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plumed serpent!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny. &ldquo;Jerry,
perhaps Tommy was right!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take us to this man,&rdquo; the reporter directed the
landlady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know if he&rsquo;s still here? The men come
and go and so long as they&rsquo;re paid up, I don&rsquo;t pay no
attention. What&rsquo;s he done anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing very serious,&rdquo; Jerry replied. &ldquo;Anyway,
we&rsquo;re not from the police station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s pretended friendliness vanished.
&ldquo;Then what you pryin&rsquo; around here for?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;Who are you anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re newspaper reporters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want my name in the paper, and we don&rsquo;t
want nothing written about this place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo; Jerry advised. &ldquo;Your name won&rsquo;t
be in the paper. We&rsquo;re only looking for a man. Now
lead us to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When people take rooms or a bed in this place
they got a right to privacy,&rdquo; the woman argued unpleasantly.
&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t none o&rsquo; my business what folks
have done that come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to talk to this man who registered as
Smith. Either take us to him, or we&rsquo;ll have to call in
the police. I&rsquo;m a personal friend of Joe Grabey, the
patrolman on this beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only kiddin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the woman said hastily. &ldquo;You
can talk to him if he&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Locking the office door behind her, the woman led
the pair down a narrow corridor with rooms on either
side. A door stood open. Penny caught a glimpse of
a cell-like chamber, furnished only with a sagging bed,
soiled blankets, and a rickety dresser. The dingy walls
were lined with pegs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those nails are for hanging up clothes, and symbolize
a man&rsquo;s rise in the world,&rdquo; Jerry pointed out to
her. &ldquo;Men who patronize the flops usually have only
the suit on their backs. But when they make a little
money and get two suits, they need a safe place to keep
the extra clothes during the day. So they rent one of
these tiny rooms which can be locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leading the way down a dark hall to the very end,
the landlady opened a door. This room with paper-thin
walls, sheltered perhaps twenty men, each cot
jammed close to its neighbor. The air was disagreeable
with the odor of strong disinfectant which had
been used on the bare wood floor.</p>
<p>The room now was deserted save for a man in
baggy black trousers who sat on one of the cots, reading
a comic magazine. Other beds were made up, but
empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that man Ben Smith?&rdquo; Penny asked in disappointment,
for he bore not the slightest resemblance
to the picture of Mr. Rhett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know what became of Smith, if he
ain&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; the landlady answered. She called to the
man on the cot. &ldquo;Jake, seen anyone in here during the
last hour?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>He shook his head, staring curiously at the intruders.</p>
<p>To Jerry the woman said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to come
back later if you want to see Smith. Maybe after ten
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry scribbled his name and telephone number on
a sheet of notebook paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does show up, will you telephone me?&rdquo; he
requested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; the woman replied, her careless tone
making it clear she would never put herself to so much
trouble.</p>
<p>Jerry gave her a five dollar bill. &ldquo;This should make
it worth your while,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll earn another
five if we find the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you the minute he comes in,&rdquo; the woman
promised with more enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Penny drew a deep breath as she and Jerry left the
building, stepping out into the cool, sweet air of the
street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still doubt we&rsquo;re trailing the right man,&rdquo; remarked
Jerry. &ldquo;Why would Hamilton Rhett hole in
at a place like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem out of the picture. However, we
know he wore a serpent ring at the time of his disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ring may not be the same. Also, if Rhett had
been the victim of violence, a bum might have stolen
it from him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that. Should we report what
we&rsquo;ve learned to the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; advised Jerry. &ldquo;Our clue is pretty
flimsy. Let&rsquo;s watch and wait. The landlady may call
us, and in any case I&rsquo;ll keep my eye on this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It now was so late that Penny decided to return
home immediately. Bidding Jerry goodbye at the
next corner, she boarded a bus and presently was slipping
quietly into her own home.</p>
<p>If she had hoped to elude the watchful eye of
Mrs. Maud Weems, the housekeeper, she was doomed
to disappointment.</p>
<p>The plump, kindly lady who had looked after
Penny since the death of Mrs. Parker many years before,
had finished the dishes and was sweeping the
kitchen. Fixing the girl with a stern eye, she observed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re later than ever tonight, Penny. When
your father came home nearly two hours ago, he had
no idea what had become of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Dad isn&rsquo;t keeping tab on his employes,&rdquo;
chuckled Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working on a special
story for the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that one before,&rdquo; sighed the housekeeper.
&ldquo;In fact, I suspect you charge a great many
of your escapades to your work! If I had my way
you would give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Weems, don&rsquo;t be cross,&rdquo; Penny pleaded,
giving her a squeeze. &ldquo;Newspaper work is wonderful!
Next time I&rsquo;ll telephone you if I know I&rsquo;ll be
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had anything to eat?&rdquo; the housekeeper
asked in a softened tone. &ldquo;Dinner was over an hour
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dig up something for myself from the refrigerator.
Where&rsquo;s Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as Penny asked the question, Anthony Parker,
a tall, lean man with graying hair, came to the arched
doorway of the kitchen. &ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; he
inquired. &ldquo;Penny off the reservation again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems made no reply, knowing only too well
that in almost any argument the publisher would support
his daughter. Many times, and without success,
she had told him she disapproved of his system of
granting Penny almost unrestricted freedom.</p>
<p>No one doubted that Mr. Parker was an over-indulgent
father, but the publisher had raised his daughter
according to a strict code. He knew that she had
writing talent and a flair for tracking down a story.
Only because she had demonstrated that she could
look after herself and think clearly in an emergency,
did he allow her to make most of her own decisions.</p>
<p>Now, Penny eagerly poured out an account of her
experiences in trying to get the Rhett story for the
<i>Star</i>. Mr. Parker, who had read most of it in the
Green Streak edition, listened attentively, offering
little comment other than to say:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I met Rhett once at a Chamber of Commerce
luncheon. Not a bad fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he like?&rdquo; Penny inquired eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet and rather bored by the meeting. I don&rsquo;t
recall that he said a dozen words during the luncheon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he look like a man who would walk off with
$250,000 in bonds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I noticed,&rdquo; commented the publisher
dryly. &ldquo;But then, nobody can judge character by
external appearances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hat in hand, Mr. Parker moved toward the kitchen
exit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going back to the <i>Star</i> office?&rdquo; his daughter
asked with alert interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Mr. Parker edged nearer the door, but
Penny blocked the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where are you going, Dad? You&rsquo;re holding
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I give you a schedule of my life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re slipping off somewhere, and you don&rsquo;t
want me to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you must know, I thought I would drop in at
the Gay Nineties, a new night club that is opening
tonight. The proprietor is one of our best advertisers
and he extended a special invitation to attend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; chuckled Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you in five
minutes. Just give me time to wash my face and pull
the snarls out of my hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid of it,&rdquo; groaned the publisher. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
you any school work to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a bit. Besides, it&rsquo;s Saturday night and I
haven&rsquo;t had any dinner. You can buy me a great big
steak with all the trimmings. And perhaps you will
dance with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker gazed helplessly at Mrs. Weems, but
the housekeeper did not come to his rescue. Her
shrug indicated that the problem was entirely his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all right,&rdquo; he gave in. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll warn you
now, this is no party. We&rsquo;ll drop in for an hour or
so, then come straight home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was off like a shot, bounding upstairs to her
room. There was no time to change her dress, but she
freshened up, and was ready by the time her father
had backed the car from the garage.</p>
<p>The Gay Nineties on Euclid Avenue twinkled with
lights, and many persons in evening dress were entering
beneath the bright red street canopy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like all the socialites of the city are here,&rdquo;
Penny observed. &ldquo;Maybe I should have worn my
pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or washed behind your ears,&rdquo; Mr. Parker chuckled,
escorting her inside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Penny and her father were given one of the best
tables in the night club. Studying the menu, the girl
was a trifle alarmed to note the prices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dreadfully hungry too,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Dad,
I hope you&rsquo;re not intending to charge this outing
against my allowance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;d have no chance to collect,&rdquo; he teased.
&ldquo;Just relax and select whatever you want. I can stand
it this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the order had been given, Penny glanced
about the dimly lighted room. The floor show had
not yet started. Everywhere she saw well-to-do and
prominent persons who had turned out for the gala
opening.</p>
<p>Suddenly her attention centered upon a couple who
had just entered the door. The woman wore an obviously
new white evening gown, and behind her
came a short, stubby little man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; she whispered, giving him a kick with the
toe of her slipper. &ldquo;See that man who just came in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he asked, turning his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s with the middle-aged woman in white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, who are they?&rdquo; Mr. Parker commented,
only mildly interested. &ldquo;No one I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man is Albert Potts, secretary to Mr. Rhett
at the First National Bank,&rdquo; Penny replied impressively.
&ldquo;How do you suppose he can afford to come
to such an expensive night club? If you ask me, Dad,
it looks odd!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">11</span>
<br /><i>THE WOODEN DOLL</i></h2>
<p>Mr. Parker studied the bank secretary and his wife
with more interest. But he said mildly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see nothing especially significant in Potts coming
here, Penny. The club is public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s expensive too. The cover charge is two dollars,
and you can&rsquo;t touch a dinner for less than another
four! How can Potts afford to pay such prices?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may earn a good salary working for Mr. Rhett&mdash;probably
does. Anyway, folks don&rsquo;t always spend
their money wisely, even if they have very little of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Potts and his wife swept past the Parker table without
noticing Penny or her father. A trifle self-consciously,
as if unaccustomed to appearing in such
places, they sat down and studied the menu with concentrated
interest.</p>
<p>Penny tried but could not keep her eyes from the
pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, I wonder if Potts has any more information
about Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s disappearance,&rdquo; she presently remarked.
&ldquo;I have a notion to go over there and ask
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>Mr. Parker nodded absently, so Penny started across
the room. She was only midway to Potts&rsquo; table, when
the bank secretary raised his eyes and saw her approaching.</p>
<p>A startled, almost dismayed expression came upon
his face. He spoke hurriedly to his wife. She looked
puzzled, but both arose and walked quickly toward
the exit.</p>
<p>Penny started to follow, then thought better of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Potts knows I&rsquo;m a reporter,&rdquo; she reflected.
&ldquo;Probably he doesn&rsquo;t care to be annoyed by having
to answer questions. On the other hand, is it possible
he doesn&rsquo;t want to be recognized in this night club?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Potts obtained their wraps at the
checkroom and left the building. Somewhat crestfallen,
Penny returned to her own table to find her
father chatting with acquaintances.</p>
<p>Under the circumstance, she had no opportunity to
speak of Mr. Potts&rsquo; queer behavior. Soon, dinners
were brought and after that the floor show began.</p>
<p>Not wishing to keep his daughter out late, Mr.
Parker insisted that they leave in the middle of the
entertainment. However, the drive home gave Penny
time to tell him about the bank secretary. The incident
did not seem to impress her father greatly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I were you I wouldn&rsquo;t pester Potts too much,&rdquo;
he advised. &ldquo;He probably doesn&rsquo;t enjoy being the
center of public attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny slept late the next morning, and because it
was Sunday, did not visit the <i>Star</i> office. The paper
that day was voluminous. But in going through it
she could find no new facts about the Rhett case. No
word had been received from the missing banker;
there had been no ransom demand received; and
neither had Albert Potts nor Mrs. Rhett shed the
slightest light on what might have become of him.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Penny telephoned Jerry Livingston
to inquire if he had heard from the Cherry Street
landlady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; he reported. &ldquo;I dropped back there
late last night, but the man we&rsquo;re looking for apparently
never returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disappointed that the case had reached a dead end,
Penny next telephoned the Rhett home. No one
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain someone is there,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Mrs.
Rhett probably has given orders not to answer the
phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a loss to know what to do, Penny spent the
morning at home, had dinner, then went down the
street to see Louise Sidell. However, her chum had
gone to visit an aunt for the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What miserable luck!&rdquo; Penny muttered. &ldquo;No
one with whom I can talk over the Rhett case!
Nothing to do!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Suddenly it dawned upon her, that she might call
on Albert Potts at his home, and perhaps induce him
to reveal a few helpful facts about the missing banker.</p>
<p>From a telephone book she obtained the secretary&rsquo;s
address. Thirty minutes later found her standing before
a modest cottage on Berdan Avenue. In response
to her knock, the same woman Penny had seen the
previous night at the Gay Nineties, came to the door.
Now she looked very plain and frowsy in a messy
housedress, and her hair hung in untidy streamers.</p>
<p>The woman stared at Penny without recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Potts here?&rdquo; the girl inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; Mrs. Potts answered without cordiality,
her voice coarse and unattractive. &ldquo;Anything
I can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to talk to him. Will he return soon?&rdquo;
Penny moved inside the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he goes off, I never know when he&rsquo;ll get
back. He went to the bank, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Sunday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al&rsquo;s had a lot of work lately. I tell him he ought
to let up. He&rsquo;s getting so jumpy he doesn&rsquo;t sleep at
nights. Just tosses and keeps me awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Penny could ask another question, a boy of
ten, who had Albert Potts&rsquo; sharp features, came racing
across the yard up to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the bicycle come yet, Ma?&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it hasn&rsquo;t, and I wish you&rsquo;d quit pestering me!&rdquo;
she snapped. &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any deliveries today.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>To Penny, the woman explained: &ldquo;My husband
bought Eddie a new bicycle and he won&rsquo;t give us any
peace until it comes. Deliveries take such a long time
these days. None of the things we bought have come
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not mean to be inquisitive, but instantly
it struck her as unusual that the Potts&rsquo; family should
be indulging in a sudden orgy of spending. Nor had
she forgotten the couple&rsquo;s hasty departure from the
Gay Nineties club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie is getting quite a few new things, I take it,&rdquo;
she observed casually.</p>
<p>The woman became more friendly. &ldquo;Oh, yes, my
husband ordered a trapeze set for him, and an electric
train. But he bought me a lot too! A new piano and
a living room rug. We have a new refrigerator on
order, a vacuum cleaner and a bedroom suite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny. &ldquo;Your husband must
have come into a small fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was given a raise last week at the bank. I don&rsquo;t
know exactly how much, but it must have been a big
one, because Al says we&rsquo;ll have enough now for everything
we need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve seen you before, Mrs. Potts,&rdquo; Penny
remarked, seeking additional information. &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t
you at the Gay Nineties last night?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we were! But we didn&rsquo;t stay long. Before
we had ordered our dinner, my husband remembered
an important appointment he had made. We had to
leave suddenly. It was awfully disappointing. I
never went to a night club before and I wanted to see
the show!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Potts paused, obviously waiting for Penny to
leave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell my husband you called,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t give me your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edging out of the door, Penny pretended not to
hear the latter remark. Calling over her shoulder that
she would try to see Mr. Potts at the bank next day,
she retreated before the woman could learn her
identity.</p>
<p>Walking toward the bus stop, the girl reflected
upon what she had learned. The financial good
fortune of the Potts&rsquo; family was very puzzling. Apparently
the bank secretary&rsquo;s salary had been increased
since the disappearance of his employer, Mr. Rhett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems a queer time to raise the man,&rdquo; she mused.
&ldquo;If his duties have become so much heavier, I suppose
the bank board may have granted a compensating
wage increase. But it must have been an enormous
one to enable him to buy everything in the stores!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Penny waited at the street corner for a home-bound
bus, she saw one approaching which was
headed for the outlying section near the Rhett estate
area. Impulsively, she decided to go there to see
Lorinda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I may not get into the house,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;My
luck is running badly today. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll give it a
try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was nearly four o&rsquo;clock by the time Penny
alighted from the bus and walked to the Rhett estate.
Her heart sank as she noticed that curtains were
drawn in nearly all of the front windows of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one here,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Lorinda and her
mother may have left town to escape questioning by
reporters and the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because she had come so far, she knocked on the
front door. No one came. Giving it up, she wandered
around the house, into the garden.</p>
<p>Curiously she gazed toward the thatched roof cottage,
wondering if anyone were there. The whispered
warning she and Salt had heard the previous day, remained
unexplained. She longed to investigate, yet
hesitated to trespass.</p>
<p>As she debated, Penny observed a small column of
black smoke rising from amid the shrubbery. Someone
apparently had built a bonfire on the beach.</p>
<p>Seeking the steps which led down to the river,
Penny presently saw that her guess was correct. A
small fire of driftwood had been built on the sands.
Lorinda, in slacks and an old sweater, was so engrossed
in feeding the flames that she did not hear when her
name was called.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>Descending the steps, Penny hastened to the beach
to join the Rhett girl. Lorinda did not hear the approaching
footsteps. Deeply absorbed in what she
was doing, she stirred the flames with a stick until they
leaped merrily.</p>
<p>Then, from a paper sack she withdrew a queer
wooden object which even from the distance Penny
could see was a doll. Its body appeared to be tightly
wound with scarlet thread.</p>
<p>Lorinda held the doll gingerly in her fingers. She
stared at it a moment, shuddered, and then with a
gesture of abhorrence, hurled it into the crackling
flames.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">12</span>
<br /><i>SUPERSTITION</i></h2>
<p>Penny quickened her step. &ldquo;Lorinda!&rdquo; she
called again.</p>
<p>The girl at the bonfire whirled around. Seeing
Penny, she gave the wooden doll a shove with the toe
of her shoe, trying to bury it beneath a pile of burning
wood.</p>
<p>Penny was not to be so easily deceived. Reaching
the fire, she asked directly: &ldquo;Lorinda, what in the
world are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re burning something you don&rsquo;t want me to
see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. Just an old doll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wooden object had not yet caught fire, and
Penny could still see it plainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s an effigy doll!&rdquo; she exclaimed, then observing
the face clearly, she added in a shocked voice:
&ldquo;A likeness of your mother!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>The scarlet string around the doll&rsquo;s body caught
fire, and soon tongues of flame began to consume the
wood. Only then did Lorinda speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it is destroyed! But I cannot so easily destroy
the evil that threatens my mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Lorinda! What do you mean? Why are
you burning this doll?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda sank down on the sand, her eyes upon the
fire. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t intended anyone to know. You swear
you will never tell Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found this doll in a downstairs coat closet. You
saw for yourself that it was an effigy of Mother and
that it was wrapped with string?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I fail to understand its significance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That scarlet wool string is known as a life-thread.
Each day a little of the thread is unwound until finally
it all is gone. Then the person dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not your mother, Lorinda! Surely, you don&rsquo;t
believe such a crazy superstition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Lorinda answered, her voice barely above
a whisper. &ldquo;<i>But Mother will</i> if she learns about the
doll. That is why she will die, unless I can do something
to break the spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Penny the words seemed fantastic, but she realized
Lorinda was deadly in earnest and convinced that
she was speaking the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to the bottom of this, Lorinda. How did
the doll come into the house?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish I knew. Obviously, it was brought
by someone who hates my mother. The doll was
carved in her image, and no doubt deadly <i>basiko</i> and
<i>dayama</i> incantations were chanted as the string was
wrapped tightly about the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you all this lingo?&rdquo; Penny demanded
suspiciously. &ldquo;Your stepfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned a little of it from him,&rdquo; Lorinda admitted,
&ldquo;but most of my knowledge came from Celeste and
Ant&oacute;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Superstitious natives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laugh if you like, but this form of dark magic
which is practiced in the jungles, is a sort of hypnotism.
The victim weakens and dies because he <i>believes
that he is doomed</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the antidote is simple. Just don&rsquo;t put any
stock in such rot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easily said, but the victim <i>always believes</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think your mother will put faith in all this?&rdquo;
Penny scoffed.</p>
<p>Lorinda gave her a strange look. &ldquo;I know she will,
if she learns about the doll. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m burning
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very sensible act. The doll is destroyed. We&rsquo;ll
keep this strictly to ourselves, and the spell is broken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make it sound very easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother hasn&rsquo;t seen the doll?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I only found it a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll never hear about it. Haven&rsquo;t you any
theory as to how the effigy got into the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Lorinda replied, after a slight hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would your stepfather have had a hand in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think so! It would be such a vicious,
wicked thing to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and your mother always got on well together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they had frequent disagreements,&rdquo; Lorinda
admitted, squirming uncomfortably. &ldquo;All the same,
my stepfather was not a cruel man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have utter confidence in Ant&oacute;n and
Celeste?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been fairly efficient servants. Mother
always has treated them well. What reason could
they have for hating her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t see any. Yet someone brought the
doll into the house after carving it in your mother&rsquo;s
image.&rdquo; Penny thought a moment, and then asked:
&ldquo;Could the Zudi drum have anything to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That angle occurred to me,&rdquo; Lorinda nodded.
&ldquo;From the first, I&rsquo;ve been afraid that natives would
trail my stepfather here and try to revenge themselves
upon him for taking the drum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste and Ant&oacute;n are not members of the Zudi
cult?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, else they never would have aided my stepfather
in acquiring the drum. I understand he never
would have heard of it if Celeste hadn&rsquo;t told him of its
existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a queer puzzle,&rdquo; Penny commented. &ldquo;While
I suppose it&rsquo;s possible natives could have followed
your father to America and now seek revenge upon
his wife, such a theory doesn&rsquo;t quite ring the gong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste thinks we should get rid of the Zudi drum.
Unless we do, she&rsquo;s convinced Mother will die a slow
lingering death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste seems to have implanted quite a few ideas
in your mind,&rdquo; Penny observed dryly. &ldquo;If you ask
me, I should say she&rsquo;s a sinister influence on the household.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Celeste means no harm. And the last few days
since my stepfather disappeared, she&rsquo;s been very devoted
to Mother, waiting on her as if she were a
baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother must be terribly worried. You&rsquo;ve
heard nothing from your stepfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word. Mother cries half the time, and this
morning she refused to leave her room. Even now I&rsquo;m
afraid she is ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Lorinda!&rdquo; reproved Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
you&rsquo;re the one who has become hypnotized by that
doll!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m silly, and that there&rsquo;s nothing
to it. But I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;terribly afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Penny picked up a stick and poked the dying embers.
She could find only a charred piece of the doll
left on the fire. Flames soon consumed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, it&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Take my advice,
Lorinda, and forget this entire incident. Don&rsquo;t
tell your mother, Celeste, or anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda scrambled up, brushing sand from her
slacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll do as you say,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;This
shall be our secret. At any rate, by burning the doll,
I should have put an end to its evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Extinguishing the few remaining flames by covering
them with sand, the girls slowly climbed the steps.
Penny inquired whether or not the police had called
at the mansion. Lorinda told her that they had spent
nearly two hours questioning Mrs. Rhett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; Penny remarked as they approached
the house, &ldquo;do you know Albert Potts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stepfather&rsquo;s secretary? I&rsquo;ve met him a few
times. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was quite a favorite with your stepfather, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A favorite?&rdquo; Lorinda chuckled. &ldquo;On the contrary,
he couldn&rsquo;t stand him! Potts was always at his
elbow, trying to tell him what to do, and what not to
do. In his way he was efficient&mdash;too efficient, if you
know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; agreed Penny. &ldquo;That was why I was surprised
to learn he had been granted a substantial salary
increase after your stepfather disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda turned her head quickly. &ldquo;A pay raise?
By the board, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who gave it to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone giving old Potts a raise,
certainly not the board. The members meet only
once a month, on the fifteenth. Of course, it&rsquo;s possible
a special session was called because of my stepfather&rsquo;s
absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may have happened,&rdquo; agreed Penny. &ldquo;At
any rate, Mr. Potts seemingly has come into money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rounding a twist in the path, the girls came within
view of the mansion terrace where Mrs. Rhett, in
white, reclined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mother is downstairs!&rdquo; Lorinda exclaimed
in surprise.</p>
<p>The woman did not see the girls until they were
very close. But as they reached the terrace, she raised
her eyes, and smiled in a brief, sad manner. Penny
instantly noted the pallor of her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I appreciate your efforts, Lorinda,&rdquo; she said before
either of the girls spoke. &ldquo;But it is useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is useless, Mother?&rdquo; inquired her daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw smoke rising from your fire on the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda glanced quickly at Penny, laughed nervously
and said: &ldquo;Oh, that! I was burning a little driftwood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Mrs. Rhett held her daughter&rsquo;s eyes in a steady,
knowing gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is useless to try to deceive me,&rdquo; she said quietly.
&ldquo;I know you burned the doll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever gave you such an idea, Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; replied the woman with quiet finality.
&ldquo;First the burnt match ends and now the doll! My
life thread is reaching its end, and I shall slowly
weaken and die.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">13</span>
<br /><i>MISSING FROM THE CHEST</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, how did you learn about the wooden
doll?&rdquo; Lorinda gasped. &ldquo;And where did you get such
a crazy idea that you will weaken and die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have known it ever since my husband went
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; cried Lorinda, fairly beside
herself with anxiety. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the doll wasn&rsquo;t in
the house until today. Someone is putting these notions
in your head! Is it Celeste?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste is doing her best to help, but there is nothing
she can do,&rdquo; Mrs. Rhett said sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, snap out of this! You&rsquo;re worried about
Father and it has made you morbid. Nothing will
happen to you. The doll has been destroyed, and in
any case, we know it&rsquo;s only a stupid effigy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropping her head wearily on the chair back, Mrs.
Rhett smiled and said nothing. Closing her eyes, she
relaxed for a moment. Penny and Lorinda thought
she might be dropping off to sleep, so they moved
quietly away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>Mrs. Rhett&rsquo;s eyes opened then and she said: &ldquo;Oh,
Lorinda!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something I wish to mention&mdash;about my
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your will?&rdquo; the girl repeated with distaste. &ldquo;Why
talk about that&mdash;now of all times!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be no better time,&rdquo; Mrs. Rhett said.
&ldquo;As you know, my will is kept in the safe. It leaves
this house and nearly all of my property to Hamilton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not talk about it,&rdquo; Lorinda pleaded nervously.
&ldquo;At the time you made the will, we decided it
was very fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so then, because you have substantial
income in your own name. Hamilton, on the other
hand, has nothing&mdash;scarcely a penny except his salary
at the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right in leaving money to him, Mother.
I never objected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The situation has changed now,&rdquo; Mrs. Rhett continued.
&ldquo;My husband may never return. If I should
die suddenly, the estate would be left to him, but he
might not appear to claim it. To my knowledge, he
has no relatives. It could all become an awkward
legal muddle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly are borrowing trouble, Mother!
Father will be found, and everything will be the same
as before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could think so, Lorinda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget about the will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rhett shook her head. &ldquo;I think I shall change
it. And soon. However, at this moment, I don&rsquo;t
know how I wish to dispose of some of my property.
Nearly everything I own is tied up in real estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman arose, and remarking that she had a
severe headache, started into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lie down for a little while,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I
feel so weak and tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda waited until her mother was well beyond
hearing. Then she turned to Penny with stricken
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard what she said! She must have learned
about that hideous doll from Celeste!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did Celeste know of it? You told her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! But Celeste has a way of knowing everything
that goes on in this household. What ought I
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were in your place I would get rid of Celeste
and Ant&oacute;n. Send them packing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suggestion seemed almost shocking to Lorinda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;In the first
place, my stepfather would be furious if he returned
and found them gone. Secondly, I doubt that they
would go on my orders. They&rsquo;re very independent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t see what you can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only my stepfather were here! Unless he returns
soon I&rsquo;m afraid something dreadful will happen
to Mother. Did she look well to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Penny hesitated, and then said truthfully:
&ldquo;She seemed pale and listless. But one can understand
that, considering what she has been through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard her give orders about her food this morning.
She told Celeste she would have trays served in
her room, and <i>no food is to be cooked with salt</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that especially significant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stepfather once told me natives who believe a
hex or <i>ouange</i> have been put on them are afraid to eat
salted food. The salt is supposed to turn to poison in
their bodies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny would have laughed had the matter not been
so serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorinda, you&rsquo;re as superstitious as a little savage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe such a thing myself,&rdquo; the girl denied.
&ldquo;But Mother apparently does. She always was afraid
of everything remotely connected with cult practices.
She never wanted my stepfather to have books on the
subject in the library, yet recently I saw her reading
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said they disagreed about his interest in
ancient cult practices?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Lorinda admitted. &ldquo;Otherwise they got on
quite well together. Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t tell you this,
but two days before he went away, they had a violent
disagreement. Mother wanted to discharge Ant&oacute;n
and Celeste, and he refused. Then on the last day my
stepfather was seen, Mother went to the bank to talk
to him. She never told me what happened there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to Albert Potts, they had another quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; Lorinda sighed. &ldquo;And now
Mother&rsquo;s attitude toward Celeste is so changed&mdash;she
actually clings to her. Oh dear, it&rsquo;s all so upsetting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to take too much upon your shoulders,&rdquo;
Penny said kindly.</p>
<p>Conversation lagged. Lorinda could not throw
aside the deep mood of depression which possessed
her. Penny knew she no longer had an excuse to
linger, yet she was unwilling to leave without asking
a few questions about the thatched roof cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorinda, why did you try to keep me from visiting
it the other day?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t know you then. My stepfather&rsquo;s
trophies all are kept in the cottage, and I didn&rsquo;t want
anyone prying about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then actually it&rsquo;s not a place of evil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda hesitated and answered indirectly: &ldquo;I almost
never go to the cottage myself. Once I was
badly frightened there&mdash;it was nothing&mdash;but for a
silly reason, I&rsquo;ve always dreaded going back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t by chance hear whispering from within
the walls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda gave her companion a quick, startled look.
&ldquo;Why do you ask, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I visited the cottage yesterday with Salt
Sommers. We distinctly heard a voice which seemed
to come from the wall itself. When we went outside
to investigate, the door slammed shut and locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has an automatic catch,&rdquo; Lorinda explained. &ldquo;I
never heard voices there, but I had a strange feeling
when I was in the room&mdash;as if the walls had eyes and
I was being watched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cottage always is kept locked?&rdquo; Penny inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my stepfather&rsquo;s trophies are valuable, and we
can&rsquo;t risk having them stolen. How did you get inside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had the grace to blush. &ldquo;Well, to make a
long story short, we went in through the window,&rdquo;
she admitted. &ldquo;It was a dreadful thing to do, and I&rsquo;m
heartily ashamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you,&rdquo; Lorinda laughed. &ldquo;Naturally
you were curious after I tried so hard to keep you
away. Would you like to see the cottage again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the key,&rdquo; Lorinda offered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>She vanished into the house and was gone so long
that Penny wondered what could be delaying the girl.
When she finally appeared on the veranda, her face
was as dark as a rain cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key is gone!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always
been kept in the top drawer of the dresser in my stepfather&rsquo;s
room. I couldn&rsquo;t find it anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he took it with him that last day he went
to the bank,&rdquo; suggested Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; agreed Lorinda, though without conviction.
&ldquo;I hope nothing has been stolen from the cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alarmed at being unable to find the key, the girls
walked hurriedly along the wooded path to the trophy
house. From afar, Lorinda saw that the door was
open a tiny crack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either the place has been ransacked, or someone is
there now!&rdquo; she declared excitedly.</p>
<p>They approached swiftly but with noiseless tread.
Lorinda suddenly flung open the cottage door.</p>
<p>The room was deserted. Trophies were exactly as
Penny had seen them the previous day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; Lorinda commented, entering, &ldquo;I
was certain I&rsquo;d find someone here. Perhaps you and
your friend failed to lock the door after you left
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It locked itself. We tried it, and couldn&rsquo;t get in.
Anyway, even if we had left the door open, that still
leaves the question of what became of the missing
key.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Lorinda nodded thoughtfully as her gaze swept the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything seems to be here,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the chest contain?&rdquo; Penny inquired
curiously. &ldquo;Salt and I wanted to peek inside yesterday,
but didn&rsquo;t have a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; Lorinda offered.</p>
<p>Pulling out the chest, she raised the lid. The top
compartment tray was empty. Looking a trifle puzzled,
Lorinda jerked it from the wooden container.
The lower section of the chest also was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, everything is gone!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;My stepfather
kept an altar cloth, a feathered head dress, two
carved knives, several rattles, and I don&rsquo;t know what
all in this chest! They&rsquo;ve been stolen!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">14</span>
<br /><i>STORM WARNINGS</i></h2>
<p>Penny dropped down on her knees beside Lorinda,
peering into the empty wooden box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t think Salt and I took anything
when we were here,&rdquo; she murmured uncomfortably.
&ldquo;We never even opened the chest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I know you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Lorinda replied.
&ldquo;Such a thought never entered my mind. But it&rsquo;s
disturbing to know these things are gone. Why
weren&rsquo;t the other trophies taken also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly, because the person who stole them
thought the objects inside the chest would not be so
quickly missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda nodded as if in agreement, and closed the
chest. As she straightened up, a tense, strained expression
came over her face, and she stiffened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>From behind the walls of the house came a muffled
dum&mdash;dum&mdash;dum of a drum. Even as the girls tensely
listened, the sound died away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Could this cottage have a secret panel?&rdquo; Penny
asked in an excited voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; Badly frightened, Lorinda tried
not to show it. &ldquo;At least I never heard of one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny began tapping the walls, none of which gave
off a hollow sound. The section by the fireplace appeared
somewhat thicker than the others. However,
if it contained a moveable panel, she could not locate
it.</p>
<p>Her gaze fell upon the cocoanut shell lamp, its bowl
nearly exhausted of oil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorinda,&rdquo; she inquired, &ldquo;is this room usually
lighted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Salt and I were here, we saw the cocoanut
shell lamp burning. A little oil is left in it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine how it came to be there,&rdquo; Lorinda
said in a hushed voice. &ldquo;My stepfather may have
filled it long ago, but he certainly never spoke of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurriedly the girls left the cottage, closing the door
tightly behind them. Lorinda tested it twice to make
certain the lock had caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sound of those drums&mdash;&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;Penny, did I imagine it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you, you didn&rsquo;t. I heard them too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the sound came from the beach,&rdquo; Lorinda
declared firmly. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have been otherwise.
No one is anywhere around here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the beach and look around,&rdquo; Penny
proposed.</p>
<p>Almost at a run, they cut across the garden to the
steps which led to the river&rsquo;s edge. Reaching the
beach they paused to listen. No sound of drums
could be heard and no one was in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have come from here,&rdquo; Penny said.
&ldquo;Lorinda, that drumming definitely was tied up with
the cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the sound was muffled and far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cottage may have a passageway connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long ago was the cottage built, Lorinda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The summer after Mother and my stepfather were
married. I remember, Mother and I went away for a
month to visit a cousin. When we returned, the cottage
was finished. My stepfather ordered it done
while we were away. Mother didn&rsquo;t like it one bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you actually weren&rsquo;t here when the cottage
was built? For all you know, a secret passageway or
false panels in the walls, may have been put in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it could have been done,&rdquo; Lorinda admitted
reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would know about the cottage except your
stepfather? Did you learn the builder&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure there was one. I think my stepfather
and Ant&oacute;n did most of the work themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk to Ant&oacute;n,&rdquo; suggested Penny. &ldquo;Perhaps
he can shed light on the mystery of those whispering,
drum-pounding walls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ant&oacute;n, however, was nowhere to be found. After
searching for him in the house and on the grounds,
the girls abandoned the search.</p>
<p>By this time it was growing late, so Penny regretfully
bade her friend goodbye, and returned home.</p>
<p>Try as she would, she could not forget the strange
events of the afternoon, nor Mrs. Rhett&rsquo;s obsession
that she would have a long and fatal illness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even now that woman is mentally ill,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;I do hope Lorinda calls in a doctor without delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although removed from the depressing mansion
atmosphere, Penny found it impossible to forget the
effigy and the conviction Lorinda had of its powers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; she said abruptly that night when dinner
was over. &ldquo;Do you believe in black magic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in any kind of magic, black, red,
pink or green,&rdquo; he answered absently. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on
your mind now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny told him of her adventure at the Rhett estate.
She confidently expected her father to make light of
the entire affair, but to her surprise he listened with
flattering attention and asked many questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fantastic!&rdquo; he exclaimed when she finished.
&ldquo;Utterly fantastic! Yet I&rsquo;ve read of cases where
natives have been taken ill and although doctors declared
not a thing was the matter with them, they
weakened and died. Is Mrs. Rhett an hysterical type
of woman?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she may be in real danger! Obviously, something
underhanded is going on at the mansion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pulling himself out of a comfortable chair, Mr.
Parker went to the hall closet for his hat, coat and
cane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to the police station, are you,
Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I want to talk this over first with a man of my
acquaintance who is better versed in cult practices
and superstitions than anyone I know. He&rsquo;s Professor
Kennedy of Riverview College. He spent many years
in Africa, Egypt and along the Amazon river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I go with you, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; he invited. &ldquo;You know all the
facts, and I may get them mixed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later Penny and her father were
in the cozy study of Professor James Kennedy on
Braemer Drive. An elderly man with a very soft
voice, he greeted the Parkers cordially and displayed
keen interest as they revealed the purpose of their
call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I once met Mr. Rhett at a dinner party,&rdquo; Professor
Kennedy remarked. &ldquo;He is a highly intelligent gentleman
and we had a very animated conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did Rhett impress you as a man who might dabble
in black magic practice to gain his ends?&rdquo; Mr. Parker
inquired.</p>
<p>Professor Kennedy dropped a log on the fire before
he answered. Considering his words carefully, he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly, Mr. Rhett would have the knowledge,
but he struck me as a man of unusual character.
Suppose you explain more fully what you have in
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Kennedy listened soberly as Penny recounted
her many observations while at the Rhett
mansion. He frowned slightly as she told how Mrs.
Rhett had found the burnt match ends tied with
scarlet string. When she disclosed how Lorinda and
she destroyed the wooden doll, he no longer could
remain silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you are correct in thinking someone may
be trying to practice a little jungle magic!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Mrs. Rhett may be in grave danger unless
we take counter-measures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should anyone seek to harm her?&rdquo; Penny
inquired. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll actually be physically
hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her mind will be influenced&mdash;poisoned,&rdquo; the professor
explained. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean a drug will be
used, but there are subtle and just as effective ways.
Now those burned match ends and the doll are only
symbols, harmless in themselves, yet they are a means
by which Mrs. Rhett may be made seriously ill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Merely by the use of suggestion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all such nonsense!&rdquo; Penny protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you&mdash;yes. But not to Mrs. Rhett. Tell me,
does she know that the doll existed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she learned about it&mdash;probably from Ant&oacute;n
or Celeste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor nodded. &ldquo;The intended victim <i>always
knows</i>,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;By one means or another
he is informed through those who seek his ruin. To
be effective, the person must fear the mumbo-jumbo
hocus-pocus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Rhett does fear it,&rdquo; Penny confirmed.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s worse, she already believes herself marked
for long illness. She actually looked ill today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is mentally sick, and the symptoms will develop,
unless counter-measures quickly are adopted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you advise, Professor?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Parker. &ldquo;Perhaps if Mrs. Rhett were sent away from
Riverview for a short while&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be of no avail, for the basic belief that
she is ill would remain in her mind. No, this thing,
must be plucked out at the root. The doll has been
burned. That is good! Now the one who seeks to
will this sickness upon Mrs. Rhett must be found and
confronted with his crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know who is behind it,&rdquo; said Mr. Parker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I read in the papers Mr. Rhett has vanished. However,
I wonder, is it not possible he actually is still in
Riverview?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said yourself, Mr. Rhett doesn&rsquo;t appear
the type of man to do such a ghastly thing,&rdquo; broke in
Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did, but we dare not close our eyes to such a
possibility. I believe you mentioned two servants,
Ant&oacute;n and Celeste, who also are versed in cult practices,
no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste is the one I suspect!&rdquo; cried Penny. &ldquo;But
she has no good reason for hating Mrs. Rhett who
seemingly always has been kind to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regardless, my advice is that the two servants be
watched closely. And when the guilty person is
found, as he must be, ordinary threats or punishments
are likely to prove useless in dealing with him. He
must be fought with his own superstitious weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker and Penny talked on and on with the
professor whose discussion of the effects of auto-suggestion
only served to heighten their anxiety regarding
Mrs. Rhett. When they left the house at midnight,
Penny was deeply depressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well for the professor to say &lsquo;find the
guilty party and fight him with his own weapons,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she declared, &ldquo;but how can we do it? In the first
place, Lorinda is our only contact with the Rhett
household.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secondly, we&rsquo;re not gifted in all this hocus-pocus.
It&rsquo;s a case for the police,&rdquo; added her father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we have no proof of anything,&rdquo; Penny
pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; agreed her father. &ldquo;I may talk to the police
chief about it. Meanwhile, we&rsquo;re interested in
keeping abreast of developments for the <i>Star</i>. If
you&rsquo;re sent out there again, be watchfully alert, but
say nothing to Lorinda or anyone else about your suspicions.
The case could take an ugly turn. In that
event, I don&rsquo;t want you involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun working on the story, Dad. But I also
want to help Lorinda and especially her mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny realized her father had given excellent advice,
and made up her mind to follow it. She became
thoughtfully silent as they motored home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what the news is tonight?&rdquo; Mr. Parker
remarked, halting the car at a street corner to buy a
newspaper.</p>
<p>Glaring headlines occupied the front page. Mr.
Parker&rsquo;s first thought was that the missing banker had
been found. He snapped on the interior car light to
read the banner.</p>
<p>His stunned silence as he stared at it, caused Penny
to peer over his shoulder. The lead story was not
about Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s mysterious disappearance. Instead,
the bold black type proclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;STORM WARNINGS POSTED. RIVERVIEW
BELIEVED TO BE IN PATH OF APPROACHING
HURRICANE!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">15</span>
<br /><i>MRS. RHETT&rsquo;S ILLNESS</i></h2>
<p>News that a violent storm was sweeping toward
Riverview held the front pages throughout Monday,
and became almost the only topic of conversation on
the streets.</p>
<p>Skies remained sunny, however, and presently fears
were somewhat quieted by national wire service reports
that the hurricane was believed to be veering
eastward. Government observers now were quoted
as predicting only the edge of the hurricane would
strike the coast, and inland states might escape unscathed.</p>
<p>Accordingly, business went on much the same as
usual. Lulled by the knowledge that never in the history
of Riverview had a hurricane struck, the citizens
now and then glanced at the falling barometer, but
otherwise gave the matter little thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Although the disappearance of Hamilton Rhett had
been crowded completely from the front pages,
Penny did not lose interest in the case. Twice she
telephoned the mansion, only to receive no response.
She did not visit the estate, for Editor DeWitt kept
her busy with special assignments.</p>
<p>After school Tuesday, Penny was sent to the Hanover
Steamship Co. offices to interview a tugboat captain.
Enroute she ran into Louise Sidell. Her chum
regarded her accusingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great pal you turned out to be, Penny Parker!
Remember&mdash;you left me standing at the door of the
First National.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry, Lou,&rdquo; Penny apologized. &ldquo;I
was inside much longer than I expected to be and
when I came out, you were gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never even telephoned to tell me what happened,
you egg! I read all about it in the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have read part of the story, but not all,&rdquo;
Penny corrected. &ldquo;I called for you on Sunday when
you were out, and since then I&rsquo;ve been busier than a
hop toad. Right now I&rsquo;m on my way to the steamship
office. Want to come along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s the only way I&rsquo;ll get any information
out of you,&rdquo; Louise grumbled, falling into step.</p>
<p>As they walked toward the docks, she asked leading
questions and, by the time they reached the steamship
offices, had gleaned most of the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you believe Mr. Rhett may be somewhere in
Riverview?&rdquo; she mused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry and I thought so at first, but we&rsquo;ve nearly
abandoned the idea. The only clue we uncovered
led to a dead end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing near the tugboat office, the girls stood for
a moment watching waves pound against the docks.
A chill, persistent wind had sprung up which penetrated
their light clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;B-r! It&rsquo;s getting colder!&rdquo; Louise shivered, huddling
close to Penny. &ldquo;Maybe that storm the newspapers
predicted is heading in this direction after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Entering the tugboat office, the girls sought Captain
Dolphin. The genial old fellow had been interviewed
so many times that he knew the story of his
life almost by heart and recited it with great gusto.
Penny took a few notes and arose to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of the weather, captain?&rdquo; she
inquired casually.</p>
<p>His answer surprised her. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like the look
of &rsquo;er here,&rdquo; he said, frowning. &ldquo;Barometer&rsquo;s been
falling all day. I&rsquo;m callin&rsquo; in all my tugs off the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you believe the storm actually may strike
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not takin&rsquo; any chances,&rdquo; replied the captain.
&ldquo;Once when I was a young twirp shippin&rsquo; on
a freighter, a hurricane struck us off the Florida Keys.
We made port, but it was by the skin of a shark&rsquo;s
tooth! Never want to see another storm like that
one!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Penny pocketed her notebook, and the girls went
outside into the rising wind. More conscious now of
its icy bite, they huddled for a moment in the shelter
of the office doorway.</p>
<p>Only a few doors away stood the Hartmann Steamship
Company offices, whose large river boats plied up
the Coast and on to distant world ports.</p>
<p>Through the plate glass window of the ticket office,
Penny&rsquo;s attention was attracted to a slightly
stooped man in rumpled clothing who was talking to
the man in charge. He turned slightly, and as she
saw his profile, she was struck by his remarkable resemblance
to the newspaper photograph of Hamilton
Rhett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, see that man in the ticket office!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he look like the missing banker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise studied the stranger a moment and replied:
&ldquo;How should I know? I&rsquo;ve never seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you saw the picture the <i>Star</i> published!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man now was leaving the ticket office. Impulsively,
Penny stepped forward to intercept him.
&ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>Alert, wary eyes bore into her own as the stranger
gazed straight at her for an instant. He said nothing,
waiting for her to continue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you Hamilton Rhett?&rdquo; Penny asked, deciding
to make a direct approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you are mistaken,&rdquo; the man replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>Pushing past Penny, he went hurriedly on down
the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; commented Louise. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you
get for jumping to such rash conclusions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny, however, was far from convinced that she
had made a mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that man wasn&rsquo;t Mr. Rhett, it was his double!
Lou, did you notice if he wore a serpent ring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He kept both hands in his pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, he did!&rdquo; agreed Penny. &ldquo;Wait here for
me! I&rsquo;ll ask the ticket agent a few questions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was inside the office perhaps five minutes.
When she returned, visibly excited, she glanced anxiously
up the street. The stranger had vanished from
view down the short street, apparently having turned
at the first corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must overtake him!&rdquo; Penny cried. &ldquo;I have a
hunch we let Mr. Rhett pull a fast one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurriedly, the girls walked to the corner. The
stranger was nowhere to be seen. Whether he had
disappeared into a building, down an alley or another
street, they had no way of knowing. Penny stopped
two pedestrians to inquire, but no one had noticed
the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost him!&rdquo; she exclaimed to Louise. &ldquo;How
disgusting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did the ticket man tell you, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That the man was inquiring about steamship accommodations
to New Orleans, and on to South
America. He didn&rsquo;t give his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how can you be sure it was Mr. Rhett?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a hunch. But the agent said the man was
wearing a ring&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t notice the type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any number of men wear rings,&rdquo; Louise scoffed.
&ldquo;Penny, aren&rsquo;t you indulging in a little wishful thinking?
You want to find Mr. Rhett so badly you&rsquo;re letting
your imagination run riot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Penny admitted with a sigh.
&ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;ve lost the fellow, so we may as well
forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying goodbye to Louise, she hastened off to the
<i>Star</i> office to write up the interview with the tugboat
captain. However, she could not put her mind on
her work, and after making three false starts, she decided
to postpone the story until after dinner.</p>
<p>Fortified by a good meal, she wrote the story much
easier, but Penny was far from satisfied when she
turned her finished copy in at the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;m off the beam tonight,&rdquo; she remarked to
Jerry. &ldquo;It took me an age to write that story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny glanced at the clock. Time had passed
swiftly for it was now after nine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look tired,&rdquo; observed the night editor.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more for you to do. Why don&rsquo;t
you skip out?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I will,&rdquo; agreed Penny, reaching for her hat.
&ldquo;I have a geometry test coming up tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was through the swinging barrier, and half way
down the hall when Jerry called to her: &ldquo;Telephone
for you, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sigh, she returned to take the call. Weariness
vanished and she became wide-awake as she recognized
Lorinda Rhett&rsquo;s voice at the other end of the
line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Parker?&rdquo; the girl inquired in an agitated voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to bother you,&rdquo; Lorinda went on, &ldquo;but
could you possibly come to our house right away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I think so,&rdquo; Penny said, instantly divining
that something was amiss at the mansion. &ldquo;Is anything
wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! Everything! I can&rsquo;t tell you over the
phone. Just come as quickly as you can. I need your
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After hanging up the receiver, Penny related the
conversation to the night editor. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly
what the call means,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Possibly,
Lorinda has learned something about her missing stepfather.
If so, it should make a good story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us a ring from the mansion if any thing develops,&rdquo;
the night editor instructed. &ldquo;Better take
Jerry along with you. No telling what may turn up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry already was on his feet, reaching for his hat.
His car was parked on the street. Traffic flow had
dwindled, enabling them to reach the mansion in record
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>The lower floor of the Rhett home was dark, but
on the second floor, nearly all the rooms were ablaze
with light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s up!&rdquo; mused Jerry, parking the car
across the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorinda is expecting me alone,&rdquo; Penny said.
&ldquo;Maybe it would be better for you to wait here until
I have a chance to talk to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Just signal if you need me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry switched off the car lights and settled himself
for a lengthy vigil.</p>
<p>Penny ran up the walk and pounded on the door.
In a moment, she heard footsteps; the living room
light flashed on; then the door was opened by Lorinda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is anything the matter?&rdquo; Penny inquired anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mother,&rdquo; Lorinda explained. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s very ill.
We have the doctor now. I&rsquo;m dreadfully worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny, at a loss to understand how she could be of
help, nodded sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me upstairs,&rdquo; Lorinda requested. &ldquo;I
want you to see and talk to Mother, and then tell me
what you think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What seems to be the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She refuses food and she has rapidly failed since
you last saw her. I&rsquo;ve tried to reason with her, but it
is useless. She is convinced she has a fatal illness and
will die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deeply troubled, Penny followed Lorinda upstairs
to the luxuriously furnished bed chamber. Celeste,
in white starched uniform, was hovering anxiously
over the bed where Mrs. Rhett lay. Lorinda&rsquo;s mother
looked ten years older than when Penny had last seen
her. Her face was pale and shriveled, her eyes listless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the food!&rdquo; she said peevishly to Celeste,
pushing aside a spoonful of custard which was
held to her lips. &ldquo;It is useless to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other side of the bed stood a stout, middle-aged
man whom Lorinda introduced as Doctor Everett,
a specialist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Rhett,&rdquo; he said sternly, &ldquo;you are acting very
foolish in refusing food. I have made a careful examination
and can find nothing whatsoever the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t call you to this house,&rdquo; the woman retorted.
&ldquo;Please go away and leave me alone. One
has a right to die in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not die,&rdquo; said the doctor patiently.
&ldquo;Your illness is only a fancy of the mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rhett tossed her head on the pillow. &ldquo;Go
away!&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;It was my daughter who called
you here&mdash;not I. No doctor can be of the slightest
aid to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless you are willing to cooperate. Now I
suggest that a trained nurse be called in to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A trained nurse!&rdquo; cried Celeste, straightening from
the bedside. &ldquo;Only I will tend my mistress! We will
have no stranger in the household!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want Celeste,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Rhett, clinging to
the servant&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;She is the only one who understands
my ailment. Celeste will take care of me&mdash;no
one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor shrugged. &ldquo;Very well, it was only a
suggestion. I should like to help you, but under the
circumstance, there is nothing I can do. Good evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the doctor reached for his black bag, Lorinda
moved quickly across the room. Her eyes pleaded
with him to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Everett, you&rsquo;ll come again tomorrow?&rdquo;
she requested.</p>
<p>He smiled, but shook his head. &ldquo;You might call
Doctor Fellows, a psychiatrist,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;There
is nothing I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Lorinda accompanied the doctor to the front
door, Penny remained in the bedroom. No sooner
had the physician left than Celeste moved close to the
bed, muttering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! He is gone! Only a fool would believe
a doctor could help you. Until the <i>ouange</i> is broken,
food will only turn to poison in your body! You will
weaken and die. But Celeste will save you&mdash;Celeste
will find a way to break the evil spell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">16</span>
<br /><i>AN OPEN WINDOW</i></h2>
<p>Unmindful of Penny, Celeste bent lower over
her bed-ridden mistress, whispering words into her
ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste! What are you saying?&rdquo; Penny demanded.
&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re putting dangerous ideas into
Mrs. Rhett&rsquo;s mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant whirled toward her angrily. &ldquo;Go
away!&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;My mistress does not want
you here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste!&rdquo; reproved Mrs. Rhett, but in a mild voice.</p>
<p>Penny stood her ground, stubbornly determined
that a servant should not order her away. For a moment
she and Celeste measured each other with steady
gaze. Nothing more was said. Mrs. Rhett sighed,
closed her eyes, and seemed to drowse.</p>
<p>Lorinda came bounding up the stairs two at a time.
Unaware that anything unpleasant had transpired during
her absence, she said with forced cheerfulness:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mother, let&rsquo;s have no more nonsense.
You&rsquo;re to eat your food without fuss. Here, let&rsquo;s try
the custard again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rhett pushed away the spoon. &ldquo;No, Lorinda,
it is useless. But there is something you may do
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you wish, Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring pen and ink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you really strong enough to write a letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to change my will. Lorinda, we spoke of
this the other day. While I still have the strength I
must revoke my former will and leave all my property
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother, don&rsquo;t talk of such things! Why, the
doctor says you&rsquo;re in perfect physical condition.
You&rsquo;ll be up and around in another day or two. It&rsquo;s
only worry about Father that has put you under the
weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have made up my mind, Lorinda. The will
must be changed&mdash;now&mdash;tonight, while I have the
strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, if it will make you rest easier,&rdquo; Lorinda
said reluctantly. &ldquo;Celeste, bring ink, a pen and paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celeste made no move to obey. &ldquo;My mistress is
not strong enough to write,&rdquo; she mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother wishes to change the will. Please bring
the materials.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To change the will while one lies on a sick bed is
to invite great trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste! No more of such talk! Do as you are
told!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny thought the servant would refuse to obey,
but she shuffled off. Many minutes passed before she
returned with the requested materials.</p>
<p>Lorinda sat down at the bedside, and wrote at her
Mother&rsquo;s dictation. It was a simple will in which
Mrs. Rhett left all of her property to her daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I thought my husband ever would return, I
would want him to receive all my holdings,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;As it is, I think the money should go to you, Lorinda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was tempted to speak of her own belief that
Mr. Rhett might be alive and in the city. However,
realizing she had not a scrap of proof, she wisely remained
silent.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rhett signed the will. Lorinda and Penny
then added their names as witnesses to the document.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lock the will in the safe,&rdquo; Mrs. Rhett instructed
her daughter. &ldquo;Do it now, before you forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seemingly relieved that the matter had been accomplished,
Mrs. Rhett turned over in bed and tried to
sleep. Leaving Celeste to look after her, Penny and
Lorinda went downstairs to the study.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste seemed to be displeased because your
mother changed the will,&rdquo; Penny remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Celeste has become a problem. I feel the doctor
was right in suggesting a nurse for Mother. Celeste
<i>may</i> mean well, but she is a distinct influence for
the worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not get rid of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda laughed shortly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know Celeste
if you think she would take such an order
from me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then have your mother dismiss her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure she would do it. Furthermore, Celeste
might defy her too. She has the idea she&rsquo;ll take
orders only from my stepfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re actually afraid of the woman,&rdquo;
Penny commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way I am,&rdquo; Lorinda admitted. &ldquo;Mother used
to dislike her intensely. Strangely, since she has become
ill, she seems to depend more upon Celeste than
she does upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it ever occur to you that Celeste might deliberately
be planting ideas in your mother&rsquo;s mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve thought of it. I don&rsquo;t believe Celeste
would be evil enough to do it on purpose, but she is
highly superstitious. I wish she were out of the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You could get rid of her if you really wanted to.
Just call in the police, and have them take over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do that. Mother would never forgive
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls entered the study, and Lorinda switched
on a light. After pulling the blinds, she removed the
wall picture, and prepared to open the safe.</p>
<p>Before she could spin the dials, footsteps padded on
the stairway. Celeste appeared suddenly in the study
doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come quick!&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Mistress much
worse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda dropped the will on the table, and with
Penny close at her heels, followed Celeste up the stairway.
Expecting the worst, they peered anxiously at
Mrs. Rhett. She was tossing restlessly, but otherwise
appeared the same as when they had seen her a
few minutes ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel, Mother?&rdquo; Lorinda asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same,&rdquo; Mrs. Rhett replied listlessly.</p>
<p>Lorinda gazed questioningly at Celeste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress much better now,&rdquo; the servant said.
&ldquo;She had sinking spell while you were downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you imagined it, Celeste,&rdquo; Lorinda replied
severely. &ldquo;This really proves that we should
have a trained nurse. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll frighten us
all out of our wits.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>Celeste started to make a retort, but just then Mrs.
Rhett spoke: &ldquo;Lorinda, did you put the will in the
safe?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was doing it when Celeste called. I&rsquo;ll attend to
it right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda stooped to kiss her mother and offer a glass
of water which was declined. She then went downstairs
once more with Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose possessed Celeste to frighten
me so?&rdquo; she remarked thoughtfully. &ldquo;Did Mother
seem changed to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a particle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching the study, Lorinda went directly to the
table where she had left the signed will. The paper
was not there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Penny, what did I do with it?&rdquo; she demanded
in bewilderment. &ldquo;I was certain I left it
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I distinctly recall that you did,&rdquo; Penny replied,
her gaze wandering to an open window where a curtain
fluttered in the breeze. &ldquo;Lorinda, I think while
we were away, someone came in from outside and
took the will!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">17</span>
<br /><i>THE STOLEN WILL</i></h2>
<p>Penny darted to the open window, peering out
onto the dark street. No one was in sight, although
Jerry&rsquo;s car with dimmed headlights still stood at the
curb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could have taken the will?&rdquo; Lorinda wailed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it didn&rsquo;t blow out the window and it didn&rsquo;t
sprout legs and walk off either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Celeste&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was upstairs all the time we were out of this
room,&rdquo; Lorinda interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed odd she called us just at the moment she
did&mdash;particularly when your mother had not suffered
a relapse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda did not appear to hear Penny&rsquo;s remark.
Half doubting that the paper could be missing, she
searched on the floor near the safe, under the window
and in every corner of the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect someone deliberately stole that will!&rdquo;
Penny said with conviction. &ldquo;Wait here! I may be
able to learn more about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastening outdoors, she gazed about the grounds.
No one was in sight. She went directly to the press
car. The automobile was deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what became of Jerry?&rdquo; she asked herself
impatiently. &ldquo;Just when I need him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disappointed, she turned toward the house again.
Then she saw the reporter coming up a dark path
from the direction of the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry!&rdquo; she called softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Penny!&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;Ready to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Everything is in a dreadful mess here.
Lorinda&rsquo;s mother is very sick. She made a will, and
Lorinda started to put it in the safe. Then we were
called out of the room by the housekeeper, and when
we returned, the paper was gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did that happen, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that fellow I chased must have been the
thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw someone take the will, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sitting in the car,&rdquo; the reporter related. &ldquo;A
light was on in one of the downstairs rooms, but I was
too sleepy to pay much attention. Suddenly though,
I saw a man who apparently had been hiding in the
shrubbery, rise up and climb through an open window.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A man! Could you see who it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was too dark. I jumped out of the car, but
before I could cross the yard, the fellow climbed out
through the window again, and started off. I called
to him. He covered his face and ran. I chased him,
but the fellow ducked down a path and I lost him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have stolen the will, Jerry! But how did
he know about it, and why would it be of any value
to him? Everything is so mixed up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we ought to give the police a buzz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what Lorinda wants to
do,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Until now, the Rhetts have studiously
avoided telling their troubles to the police&mdash;in
fact, I am afraid Mrs. Rhett hasn&rsquo;t told everything she
knows about her husband&rsquo;s disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait in the car,&rdquo; Jerry said.</p>
<p>Penny let herself into the house again and made her
way through the dark living room to the library
where a light burned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorinda&mdash;&rdquo; she began, only to stop short.</p>
<p>For it was not Lorinda who stood with her back
toward the door, awkwardly turning the dials of the
wall safe. Instead, Celeste whirled around, plainly
dismayed by the girl&rsquo;s unexpected appearance in the
doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste!&rdquo; Penny said sharply. &ldquo;What are you
doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; the woman muttered, her mouth sullen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You were trying to get into that safe! Is it the
will you want, or are you after the Zudi drum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s words, shot blindly, struck the target. Celeste&rsquo;s
eyes flashed and she advanced a step toward the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go away from here! Never come back!&rdquo; she
ordered harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m not taking orders from you, Celeste.
Why do you hate Lorinda and Mrs. Rhett? What is
your little game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celeste glared at Penny. She drew in her breath
and expelled it with a hissing sound through her yellow,
crooked teeth. Her hand clutched at an object
hidden beneath her uniform and worn around her
neck on a dirty cord.</p>
<p>With no warning, she broke into a jargon which
Penny could not understand. But the meaning was
clear enough even if the words were unintelligible.
Celeste was calling down all manner of evil upon her
head!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; Celeste cried in English. &ldquo;You come here
again&mdash;harm befall you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste, all your jungle hocus-pocus doesn&rsquo;t impress
me in the least. I&rsquo;ll leave when I feel in the
mood&mdash;not before. What were you after in the
safe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s eyes met Penny&rsquo;s defiantly. She
reached out as if to strike her, but at that moment
footsteps padded on the stairway. Pushing past
Penny, Celeste retreated to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Lorinda came into the library, gazing about curiously.
&ldquo;Thought I heard voices,&rdquo; she commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did. Celeste was here. Guess what? I
found her tampering with the wall safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may have been trying to learn if the Zudi
drum was stolen,&rdquo; Lorinda said absently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m far
more worried about the will. What became of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny repeated what Jerry had witnessed, adding:
&ldquo;Obviously the will was taken by the man who
climbed through the window. Could it have been
Ant&oacute;n?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ant&oacute;n? Why, I doubt that he even knew about
the will, because Mother decided to change it at a moment&rsquo;s
notice. What reason would he have for taking
it? Neither he nor Celeste figured in the terms
of either document.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed to me Celeste was tremendously interested,&rdquo;
Penny said. &ldquo;Oh, well, the loss shouldn&rsquo;t be
of serious consequence. Your mother can draw up
another will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what she won&rsquo;t do. I told her
about the will being taken, Penny. She immediately
decided it was another omen&mdash;a sign that she should
leave everything the way it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How foolish! Celeste must have put those notions
in her head!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. As for the will, I never
did encourage her to change it, because not for a moment
do I believe she is sick enough to die. I don&rsquo;t
want Mother&rsquo;s money. I only want her to get well
and strong and be happy again. Penny, you don&rsquo;t
think she is seriously ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor said nothing is the matter with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet we both know something dreadful is wrong.&rdquo;
Lorinda&rsquo;s finger tips nervously tapped the table edge.
&ldquo;Oh, Penny, I&rsquo;m scared&mdash;terribly scared. I don&rsquo;t explain
it, but I just <i>feel</i> a sinister something in the air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be here alone with Celeste and
Ant&oacute;n. Why not override them and hire a nurse or
companion for your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I will,&rdquo; Lorinda agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over
until tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll report the theft of the will to the police, of
course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Lorinda decided instantly. &ldquo;They would
only ask embarrassing questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so reluctant to take anyone into
your confidence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in enough trouble now, Penny. Please,
let&rsquo;s not talk about it any more until tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Decidedly puzzled by Lorinda&rsquo;s attitude, Penny
said goodbye and rejoined Jerry in the car. He had
seen no more of the mysterious prowler and was convinced
the man had fled the estate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; he said, starting the car.</p>
<p>As the automobile swung down the driveway,
Penny peered intently at the roadside shrubbery.
The bushes were crashing back and forth in the rising
wind, but no one was visible anywhere near the
estate. Chilled, she closed the car window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that hurricane really is heading our
way?&rdquo; she asked her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t see the government report tonight,&rdquo; Jerry
replied. &ldquo;Probably at the last minute, the storm will
veer off and we&rsquo;ll escape. Riverview never was struck
by a hurricane. Too far inland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car purred smoothly on, following the road
which curled toward the beach. Penny became silent.
As they turned a corner, Jerry reached out to
give her hand a friendly squeeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so quiet, kitten?&rdquo; he teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just thinking, Jerry. There are so many things
about the Rhett case I can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why trouble your little brain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because this isn&rsquo;t just an ordinary story to me,
Jerry. I like Lorinda, and I feel that unless something
is done, her mother may die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re becoming a superstitious little
heathen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not! But from what the professor told
us, it&rsquo;s a mistake to underrate the power of suggestion.
Mrs. Rhett is in real danger&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Penny broke off, listening intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that, Jerry?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t hear anything. Only the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I distinctly heard a sound like the throb of a
drum!&rdquo; Penny lowered the car window. &ldquo;There it
is again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Jerry, too, heard the sound, far away and
indistinct. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; he exclaimed, slowing the
car. &ldquo;From down the beach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny grasped his arm excitedly. &ldquo;Stop the car!&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;If we can find the drummer, we may
be able to solve part of the mystery!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">18</span>
<br /><i>THROUGH THE WINDOW</i></h2>
<p>Jerry slammed on the foot brake and the car
came to a jerky halt at the curb. Leaping out, they
stood for a moment listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hear anything now!&rdquo; the reporter muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a gander down the beach,&rdquo; Penny proposed.
&ldquo;The sound seemed to come from that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hand in hand they cut across a vacant lot where
dead weeds came waist high, then followed a sloping
path to the beach. The long stretch of sand was deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have imagined those drums,&rdquo; Jerry said,
pausing. &ldquo;Or maybe it was the Legion fife and drum
corps having a night practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the beat of a jungle drum.&rdquo; Penny turned
to gaze toward the Rhett mansion on the wooded hillside.
All the windows, save one in an upstairs bedroom,
now were dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>By the light of a three-quarters moon which was
rising over the pines, she could see the wooden steps
that led from the estate down to the beach. On either
side extended tiers of twisted limestone rock. It
occurred to Penny that somewhere among the crannies,
a cave might be tucked away. She spoke of it
to Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;but I never heard of one
around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A gust of wind caught Penny&rsquo;s felt hat, carrying it
cartwheeling down the beach. She and Jerry raced
in pursuit, colliding as they pounced on it together.
They laughed, and as the reporter pulled the hat over
Penny&rsquo;s flying hair, he kissed her quickly on the
cheek.</p>
<p>Then before she could reprimand him, he exclaimed:
&ldquo;Wow! That wind really is getting strong!
Let&rsquo;s get back to the car before we blow away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny liked Jerry and she liked the kiss. Best of
all, she appreciated his consideration in never forcing
serious attentions upon her. With a gay &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll race
you!&rdquo;, she ran ahead of him to the road.</p>
<p>Jerry took Penny directly home. Mrs. Weems had
gone to bed while Mr. Parker had not returned from
downtown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come in and have a cup of chocolate?&rdquo;
Penny invited the reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not tonight, thanks,&rdquo; he declined. &ldquo;See you tomorrow
at the office.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Penny went into the house, and after fixing herself
a snack from the refrigerator, switched on the radio
to catch the weather report. The news commentator,
on a national hookup, warned that the hurricane continued
to sweep toward the Atlantic coast, and that
inland cities also were endangered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really sounds serious,&rdquo; she thought, turning off
the radio.</p>
<p>As she went upstairs, Mrs. Weems called to her in
a sleepy voice, so Penny stepped into the housekeeper&rsquo;s
bedroom for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re home,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems said. &ldquo;Is
there any news about the approaching storm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing definite. The latest radio report said it&rsquo;s
still heading this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will it strike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late tomorrow unless it veers off. It may be quite
serious,&rdquo; Penny said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems sighed and settled beneath the covers
again. &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t one thing it&rsquo;s another! First thing
in the morning we must get the awning down, and
have all the shutters taken off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the center of the hurricane should hit here, everything
will go,&rdquo; Penny said cheerfully. &ldquo;So why
worry about shutters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The storm may be a severe one, but I don&rsquo;t believe
it will strike with hurricane force,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems insisted.
&ldquo;In any case, the shutters are coming down,
and I&rsquo;ll need your help! So don&rsquo;t try to skip out in
the morning!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Penny went to her own room, but before she could
undress, she heard her father&rsquo;s car on the driveway.
He came into the house, locked the doors for the
night, then climbed the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Dad!&rdquo; she called through the half open
door of her bedroom. &ldquo;Any news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be by morning,&rdquo; he answered grimly.
&ldquo;The <i>Star</i> is coming out with front page headlines
warning the city to prepare for the worst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stepped quickly out into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Riverview is in the path of the hurricane!
Is there danger that the city will be destroyed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damage to property is almost certain to be extensive.
I&rsquo;ve just come from a meeting with the mayor
and City Council. While there&rsquo;s an outside chance
the city may be spared, it&rsquo;s folly not to prepare for
the full brunt of the storm. The mayor has issued a
proclamation declaring an emergency and advising
everyone to keep off the streets after noon tomorrow.
Most businesses will close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the <i>Star</i> will shut down too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. At such a time, folks depend more than ever
upon their newspaper for accurate information.
We&rsquo;ll publish as long as we have a plant and our
trucks can keep delivering.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Mr. Parker&rsquo;s information brought home to Penny
the true seriousness of the situation. However, as she
peered out of her bedroom window a few minutes
later, the clear sky and bright stars belied an approaching
storm.</p>
<p>Undressed, Penny sat for a time propped up in bed
with pillows, trying to read a book. The words held
little meaning. Losing interest, she snapped off the
light, and snuggled down.</p>
<p>But she could not sleep. The dark house was filled
with many strange sounds. The stairway creaked,
the shutters rattled, and in the bathroom, water
dripped regularly from a faucet.</p>
<p>Thoughts raced rampant through Penny&rsquo;s mind.
She squirmed and tossed and became increasingly
aware of the rising wind.</p>
<p>Suddenly she was startled by a loud crash in the
yard below. Leaping out of bed, she darted to the
window. A large rotten tree limb had been ripped
from the backyard maple and now lay across the
driveway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad will have to move it before he can get the car
out of the garage in the morning,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;Some fun!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Creeping back beneath the covers, she tried again
to sleep. Instead, she found herself thinking over
everything that had occurred at the Rhett mansion.
Already the banker&rsquo;s disappearance was fading out of
the newspapers, and with a hurricane in the offing,
the story would be entirely forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police haven&rsquo;t shown much interest,&rdquo; she reflected.
&ldquo;Unless definite clues are obtained soon, Mr.
Rhett may never be traced. The case will die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny thought of the mysterious thatched roof cottage
and the whispering voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those walls must have a secret panel,&rdquo; she reasoned.
&ldquo;I believe I might find it if I had an opportunity
to make a thorough investigation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flapping shutter reminded Penny once more of
the storm. Then came the discouraging thought that
even if only the tail-end of the hurricane struck Riverview,
the flimsy thatched cottage undoubtedly would
be carried away and destroyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I get out there tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll probably lose
my chance!&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Oh, dear, how will I
make it when I have a thousand other things I&rsquo;m supposed
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dancing tree limbs cast weird shadows on the rough
plaster wall. Penny closed her eyes, but even then
sleep would not come.</p>
<p>Suddenly the window pane crashed, and glass clattered
onto the floor. Startled, Penny sat up and
groped for the night table lamp. Her first thought
was that a tree branch had hurtled against the pane,
breaking it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>But as the light went on, she saw that only a small
hole had been broken in the glass. On the floor,
scarcely two feet from the bed, lay a small object
wrapped in black cloth.</p>
<p>Penny rolled out of bed and gingerly picked it up.
Carefully and with a feeling of revulsion, she untied
the packet.</p>
<p>Inside were two black feathers, the wing of a bird,
herbs which Penny could not identify, a bit of bone,
and a small amount of damp earth.</p>
<p>There was no warning message, nothing to identify
the one who had thrown the packet, yet Penny instantly
knew its significance and from whence it had
come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either Ant&oacute;n or Celeste hurled it because I&rsquo;ve
cramped their style!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Well, their little
hex won&rsquo;t work! I&rsquo;ll use this evil charm to fashion
their own undoing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">19</span>
<br /><i>RISING WIND</i></h2>
<p>The sound of crashing glass brought both Mrs.
Weems and Mr. Parker to the bedroom. They found
Penny standing at the window, the light off, peering
down into the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s coming off here?&rdquo; Mr. Parker demanded,
his voice cross because he had been aroused from
sound slumber. &ldquo;Did something blow against the
window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was thrown,&rdquo; Penny revealed, holding up the
packet. &ldquo;Dad, can you see anyone hiding in the
shrubbery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker moved to the window, gazing intently
about the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever it was, he&rsquo;s probably gone now.&rdquo;
Penny carefully drew the blinds before snapping on
the overhead light. She handed the packet to her
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was thrown through the window. I suspect it&rsquo;s
intended as a bad luck omen, and to frighten me.
Evidently my work on the Rhett case is not appreciated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A jungle charm!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Weems, horrified.
&ldquo;Oh, Penny, I knew no good would come of
your having anything to do with that queer family!
Here, give that horrid thing to me&mdash;I&rsquo;ll burn it in the
furnace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; chuckled Penny. &ldquo;I intend to keep
it as evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it may bring you bad luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Weems, I&rsquo;m surprised at you,&rdquo; teased
Penny. &ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;re not superstitious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the housekeeper denied, &ldquo;but from what
you&rsquo;ve told me about those queer Rhett servants, I
distrust them. I don&rsquo;t want you even to touch that
ugly package!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These objects aren&rsquo;t harmful,&rdquo; Penny insisted, selecting
the bit of bone and offering it to Mrs. Weems.
&ldquo;Why attach special significance to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a shudder, the housekeeper backed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny is right,&rdquo; declared Mr. Parker. &ldquo;The
packet is silly and has no meaning unless we build it
up in our own minds. That, of course, is exactly
what the one who hurled it intends us to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny mustn&rsquo;t go to that dreadful place again!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Weems! Don&rsquo;t you see, that&rsquo;s just what
Ant&oacute;n and Celeste hope to accomplish. If they can
keep me away from the mansion merely by throwing
one of their stupid charms through my window, their
trick has been successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite agree with Penny,&rdquo; Mr. Parker declared.
&ldquo;In fact, I may call at the mansion myself! I&rsquo;ve become
interested in Ant&oacute;n and Celeste&mdash;they&rsquo;re a very
successful pair of bluffers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad! Will you go with me tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he promised vaguely. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see, when
the time comes. I foresee any number of troubles far
more serious than our concern with the Rhett family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With both of you against me, I&rsquo;m only wasting
my breath,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems sighed, drawing her robe
tightly about her. &ldquo;I may as well go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny put the black packet on the dresser after her
father had finished inspecting it. &ldquo;I intend to wear
this charm around my neck the next time I go to the
Rhetts&rsquo;,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;It will be fun to see how
Celeste and Ant&oacute;n react.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t carry your fun too far,&rdquo; her father advised.
&ldquo;While it&rsquo;s true this charm has no significance or supernatural
power, Ant&oacute;n and Celeste may be dangerous
characters. They&rsquo;ll bear watching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m the one to do it,&rdquo; Penny chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not a bit afraid of them, Dad. As you said, they&rsquo;re a
couple of bluffers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I may have used the word ill-advisedly,&rdquo; the publisher
corrected. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of underrating
them. The case, as you well know, has sinister
aspects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; Penny promised soberly.</p>
<p>After her father had returned to his room, she went
back to bed. A chill wind whistled in through the
hole in the window, but she burrowed deep beneath
the blankets and soon was sound asleep.</p>
<p>Next morning, as Mr. Parker had predicted, newspapers
carried screaming headlines, announcing that
the hurricane might reach Riverview by nightfall.
Householders were advised to take every precaution
to protect life and property.</p>
<p>School opened and was promptly dismissed at nine
o&rsquo;clock. At home, Penny helped Mrs. Weems carry
in the porch awning, remove the shutters and all loose
objects which were likely to be torn free by the wind.</p>
<p>By now, papers were blowing wildly, cluttering
the yard. Each gust brought sticks or small limbs
crashing down into the street.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems, hovering near the radio to hear the
last-minute reports, declared that the barometer continued
to fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The storm is steadily getting worse,&rdquo; she said
nervously.</p>
<p>After lunch, Penny went to the newspaper office
to inquire if Mr. DeWitt had any special assignment
for her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing right now,&rdquo; he said, rapidly scanning a
page of copy. &ldquo;But stick around. Anything may
break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny waited, growing increasingly restless. She
was certain DeWitt had forgotten all about her, when
he slammed down a telephone receiver and glanced in
her direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go out on the street and see what&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; he ordered.
&ldquo;Might check the police station, too, on your
way in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded and went out through the barrier
gate. The feel of the approaching hurricane was in
the air. Walking toward the river, she saw blue-green
water boiling into sinister white foam where it
vaulted onto the docks.</p>
<p>Pedestrians were few in number and all hurrying.
Business was at a standstill. Shutters were going up
over plate glass windows, and street signs were being
taken down.</p>
<p>Penny wandered about for a time and then, as a fine
rain began to fall, sought the police station. Checking
routine reports, she noted four injury cases caused
by flying objects, several thefts of property, and more
than the usual number of automobile accidents.</p>
<p>At the office once more, she wrote an impressionist
account of what she had seen, then waited for another
assignment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, you may as well go home while you can
get there,&rdquo; DeWitt said presently. &ldquo;City Traction is
shutting off service at six o&rsquo;clock, and after that you
won&rsquo;t be able to take a bus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At another time Penny might have been disappointed
to be sent home when exciting news was
breaking, but dismissal now fitted neatly into her
plans. She was determined to make one last investigation
of the thatched roof cottage at the Rhett mansion.
However, to beat the storm, she must move fast.</p>
<p>Going out the door, Penny met Jerry who had just
come in from the river front. His felt hat was dripping
wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting nasty outside,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;How
are you going home, Penny? By bus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eventually, but not just now,&rdquo; she grinned.
&ldquo;First, I have a little errand at the Rhetts&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better skip it,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;This storm is the
real McCoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t afford to, Jerry. I want to look over that
thatched cottage once more. If I don&rsquo;t do it now, it
probably won&rsquo;t be there by tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re set on going out there, better make it a
speedy trip,&rdquo; Jerry returned. &ldquo;The storm is rolling
in fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching the mansion twenty minutes later, Penny
was surprised to see an unfamiliar automobile parked
on the Rhett driveway. As she went up the front
walk, the door opened, and three men came outside.
Without noticing the girl, they entered the car and
drove away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder who they are and what brought them
here?&rdquo; Penny mused.</p>
<p>In response to her knock, Celeste opened the door.
Seeing Penny, the woman tried to close it in her face,
but the girl pushed boldly past her into the hallway.</p>
<p>Penny purposely had worn the black packet on a
string around her neck. While Celeste was closing
the door, she pulled it from her dress front, and then
opened her raincoat so that the housekeeper could not
fail to see the object.</p>
<p>Celeste&rsquo;s eyes instantly riveted upon the dangling
packet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good luck charm!&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;Someone
gave it to me last night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celeste&rsquo;s lips dropped apart to show her uneven
teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an evil packet!&rdquo; she hissed. &ldquo;If you wear it,
sickness and death will pursue you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this cookie,&rdquo; chuckled Penny. &ldquo;You see, I
don&rsquo;t believe such nonsense. Whoever tossed this
thing through my window went to a lot of trouble for
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celeste&rsquo;s face, an interesting study in mixed emotions,
suddenly became a blank mask. Hearing footsteps,
the woman mumbled something and scurried
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Lorinda came down the stairway. &ldquo;Oh, Penny!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, grasping her hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you
came! We&rsquo;re in such trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother is worse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is failing rapidly, and the visit of those
three bankers upset her dreadfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men I met on the walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re members of the First National Bank
board. They told Mother she must make up the
$250,000 bond loss within forty-eight hours, or my
stepfather will be exposed as a thief, and the estate
sued! It seems Mr. Potts convinced them my stepfather
had the bonds when he disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will your mother do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can she do? Nearly all of her property is
in real estate. She might be able to raise $30,000 cash
within the required time, but never the amount they
demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard nothing from your stepfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word. The police haven&rsquo;t contributed any
worthwhile clues either. They didn&rsquo;t go deeply into
the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you blame them? You and your mother
withheld facts and discouraged them at every turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you understood,&rdquo; Lorinda answered in
a low voice. &ldquo;Mother and my stepfather quarreled
violently on that last day at the bank. She didn&rsquo;t
want the truth to get out, so she tried to keep from
answering questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your stepfather disappeared as a result of
the quarrel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It is a possibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe your stepfather may have stolen the
bonds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Never! He may have had them on his
person when he went away or was spirited off, but I
am sure he is no thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shutters were flapping in the wind. The porch
furniture had not been brought into the house, and
through the window, Penny saw that many loose,
breakable objects remained in the garden. Abruptly
changing the subject, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorinda, the storm is getting worse every minute.
Can&rsquo;t we bring in the porch furniture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told Ant&oacute;n to do it early this morning. He
went off somewhere. Celeste has been no help either.
They&rsquo;re both acting so independent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need their help. Come! We can do it
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda put on her rain cape and they went out
onto the porch. Already the rug was rain soaked.
They rolled it up and carried it to the basement,
where they also took the furniture. Deciding it was
too late to do anything about nailing down the shutters
or taking them off, they brought in loose objects
from the yard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>In passing the library, Penny noticed that a window
was open. The curtain was drenched and rain
was pouring in upon the floor.</p>
<p>With a cry of dismay, she ran to close it. As she
turned around, she saw at once that the wall safe was
exposed to view, and open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorinda!&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>Her friend came quickly to the doorway. &ldquo;Anything
wrong?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>Penny directed her gaze toward the safe. &ldquo;Did you
leave it open?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; With a startled exclamation, Lorinda
darted across the room. She thrust her arm into the
circular opening, and withdrew it empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Zudi drum is gone!&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
been stolen!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">20</span>
<br /><i>TWELVE STEPS DOWN</i></h2>
<p>The news did not astonish Penny for she had anticipated
it. She said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorinda, surely now you&rsquo;ll call in the police? The
Zudi drum must be a very valuable trophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is. Yes, I suppose the only thing to do is notify
police headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda went to a telephone, but although she tried
many times, she was unable to contact the operator.
&ldquo;The line must be down,&rdquo; she reported. &ldquo;The wire
sounds dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re isolated here until after the storm.
Lorinda, why don&rsquo;t you question Celeste and Ant&oacute;n?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, but they&rsquo;ll not tell you anything,&rdquo; Lorinda
said despairingly. &ldquo;Ant&oacute;n and Celeste have
been interested in the Zudi drum ever since they came
here, but I&rsquo;ve never known them to steal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they know the safe combination?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless they learned it the last few days. I noticed
that Celeste watches lately whenever anyone
enters or leaves the library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she may have obtained the combination. I
know she was tampering with the dial yesterday.
Where is she now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the kitchen, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celeste, however, was not to be found there, nor
was she in any of the upstairs bedrooms, or in her own
room on the first floor adjoining the garage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where she and Ant&oacute;n went,&rdquo; Lorinda
declared, deeply troubled. &ldquo;I hate to accuse
them without proof, but it does look as if they&rsquo;re the
only ones who could have stolen the drum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the trophies at the thatched roof cottage?
Are they safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out,&rdquo; Lorinda proposed. &ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ll get
the key. Incidentally, it was mysteriously returned
to my stepfather&rsquo;s room yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She returned with the key in a moment, and the
girls ran down the slippery path through the falling
rain. The whine of a steadily rising wind was in their
ears as they opened the cottage door and stepped inside.</p>
<p>Lorinda looked carefully about. &ldquo;Everything
seems to be here&mdash;&rdquo; she began, only to correct herself.
&ldquo;No, the crossed machetes which were on the wall!
They&rsquo;re gone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the rattle!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny. &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda pulled out the wooden chest and raised the
lid. &ldquo;The altar cloth is missing and any number of
things! Almost everything has been taken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of checking over the few remaining
objects in the chest, Lorinda suddenly raised her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she commanded.</p>
<p>At first, Penny could distinguish only the whistle
of the wind, then she became aware of a low rumbling
murmur which seemed to come from the very
walls of the cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a chant!&rdquo; whispered Lorinda. &ldquo;I can hear
drums too, as if from a long distance away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little frightened, neither girl spoke for a while.
The strange sound died away, then was resumed.
This time they distinctly could hear the thumping of
drums.</p>
<p>Penny went to the door of the cottage to listen.
Outside there was only the whine of the wind and the
crashing of tree branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorinda, this cottage must have a secret passage!&rdquo;
she declared excitedly. &ldquo;I thought so before, and
now I&rsquo;m certain of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already Lorinda was down on hands and knees before
the fireplace, tapping the tiles. They gave forth
a hollow sound. However, she could find no opening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Penny removed a huge black kettle from hanging
chains, and peered up into the chimney. Her groping
hand encountered a rod which she assumed controlled
the draft. She pulled on it.
<a href="#front">The floor beneath her feet suddenly gave way</a>,
and she would have
pitched through the opening had not Lorinda seized
her arms and held her.</p>
<p>Scrambling back to solid flooring, Penny peered
down into the dark opening where the hearth had
been. The tiles were only a sham, she saw now, fastened
to a hinged rectangle of wood, which had fallen
back like a trap door.</p>
<p>Steep stone steps led down into inky darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I never dreamed this was here!&rdquo; Lorinda
whispered. &ldquo;It must have been built that summer
Mother and I were away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of drums and incantations came plainly
now. Neither Penny nor Lorinda was eager to investigate
the passage. They feared that they might
encounter something with which they would be unable
to cope. But to retreat was equally unthinkable.</p>
<p>Penny found the cocoanut shell lamp and lit the
floating wick. Moving ahead, she cautiously descended
the stone steps. Lorinda kept close beside
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Twelve steps led almost straight down. There the
girls found themselves in a bricked-over passageway,
so narrow they could barely squeeze through. However,
after they had gone a few yards, it widened a
little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose this leads?&rdquo; Penny whispered.
&ldquo;To the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. It seems to me the sound of the drums
came from that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The weird noises no longer could be heard and the
silence disturbed the girls. Could it be that in entering
the tunnel they had revealed their presence?
Nervous and tense, they moved forward at a snail&rsquo;s
pace, feeling their way along the wall and taking care
to make no betraying sound.</p>
<p>The tunnel led downhill. In places the roof was so
low the girls were forced to bend double to pass
through. The walls were damp and crumbly and, at
points near the roof, water dripped steadily.</p>
<p>Then presently Penny halted, shifting the lamp to
her other hand. The passage had widened into a tiny
room from which two tunnels branched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which shall we take?&rdquo; she asked Lorinda.</p>
<p>They selected the wider of the two, which soon
proved a deception. Scarcely had they left the little
dugout than it narrowed until they were barely able
to edge through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we turn back and try the other?&rdquo; Penny
suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>Lorinda wanted to keep on. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re moving uphill
now,&rdquo; she pointed out. &ldquo;I suspect this must lead
either to the house or the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her guess proved to be correct. Another twenty
yards and the tunnel terminated abruptly in front of
a door. It opened readily. A dozen roughly carved
steps led upward to a trap door. Penny pushed it
aside and blinking owlishly, climbed out into a bedroom.</p>
<p>She saw then that the trap door had been cut in the
center of the room floor, hidden from view by a large
rag rug which now lay in an untidy heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re in Celeste&rsquo;s room!&rdquo; Lorinda exclaimed
as she too emerged. &ldquo;Adjoining the garage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This explains quite a few things to me,&rdquo; remarked
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to me! Celeste must have known about this
passage all the time, but she never hinted of it to
Mother or me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ask my opinion, Celeste not only has known
about the passage, she&rsquo;s been using it regularly,&rdquo; declared
Penny, gazing curiously about the room.</p>
<p>The bed had been carelessly made, and a red bandana
handkerchief had been left hanging on one of
the wooden posts. On the dresser were a number of
objects which drew the girls&rsquo; attention. From the pin
tray Penny picked up a tiny black feather and there
were strips of torn black cloth which exactly matched
the packet she wore about her neck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This proves it!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Celeste made
the evil charm which was thrown through my window
last night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charm?&rdquo; Lorinda inquired. &ldquo;Penny, what are
you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny showed her the packet and explained how
it had been hurled through the window pane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure Celeste had Ant&oacute;n do it or perhaps she tossed it
herself. At any rate, she made the packet to frighten
me, only it didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless Celeste can explain matters satisfactorily,
I&rsquo;ll turn her over to the police!&rdquo; Lorinda said angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding her may not be so easy now. Also getting
her into police custody may take a little doing.
I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ve waited too long, Lorinda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ll find her!&rdquo; Lorinda announced with determination.
&ldquo;After all, she doesn&rsquo;t know how much
we have learned. Let&rsquo;s investigate the other passageway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Penny agreed, &ldquo;but this lamp isn&rsquo;t much
good. We need a flashlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have one in my room. I&rsquo;ll get it, see if Mother
is all right, and be right back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda was gone less than five minutes. &ldquo;Mother
is sleeping, so it&rsquo;s safe to leave her,&rdquo; she reported.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the flash, but I couldn&rsquo;t find an extra battery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Descending into the passageway, the girls retraced
their steps to the tiny dugout midway between the
thatched roof cottage and the mansion. As they entered
the other tunnel, they again heard the throb of
jungle drums, and the weird incantation of many guttural
voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A chant to the Serpent God!&rdquo; whispered Lorinda.
&ldquo;Do you hear that high-pitched drum which sounds
above the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded as she moved forward in the dark,
narrow passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Zudi,&rdquo; Lorinda added. &ldquo;I would know
its tone anywhere! We must recover it, but if what
I think is so, it will be a dangerous task!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">21</span>
<br /><i>CEREMONIAL CAVE</i></h2>
<p>The tunnel sloped gently downward, apparently
toward the river beach. As the girls moved
along, the pulsing of the drums came with increasing
crescendo. They could hear the wailing chant
plainly now, an incantation in which many voices
were united.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better switch off the light,&rdquo; Lorinda advised in a
whisper. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny darkened the flashlight, groping her way
along the damp, rocky wall. The passage now had
widened, and suddenly ahead, she saw the flickering
flame of a torch.</p>
<p>In the shadowy light swayed a half dozen celebrants
of the weird rites. The room was circular, a cavern
carved from the rocks years before by the action of
water.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s gaze focused upon the dancing figures.
Ant&oacute;n, barefooted and grotesque with a red turban
wound about his head, led the procession, beating out
a rhythm and shaking the gourd rattle which had been
stolen from the thatched cottage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Behind him came a drummer Penny did not recognize,
and three other dancers, who carried aloft a banner
upon which were metallic, glittering serpentine
symbols.</p>
<p>But it was Celeste, garbed in scarlet with an embroidered
stole over her shoulders, who dominated the
scene. Seated before an altar where two tall candles
burned, she pounded out the basic rhythm on a long,
narrow drum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Zudi!&rdquo; whispered Lorinda. &ldquo;She stole it
from the safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make her give it up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; Lorinda grasped Penny&rsquo;s arm, holding
her back. &ldquo;It would be folly to show ourselves now.
Ant&oacute;n, Celeste and their stupid converts are hypnotized
by their own music. If they knew we were
watching their rites, there&rsquo;s no telling what they
would do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste is a cruel, dangerous woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll turn her over to the police. I realize now
it&rsquo;s the only thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fascinated, the girls watched the strange sight.
The drums were beating faster now, and at each boom
of the Zudi, Ant&oacute;n leaped with frenzied glee rigid as
an arrow into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are the others?&rdquo; Penny whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Lorinda shook her head. &ldquo;No-good friends of
Ant&oacute;n and Celeste probably,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Recruits
from the slums of Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the altar were many objects, a basket of bread,
a basin of cooked fish, a carved wooden serpent and
a wreath of feathers. A kettle contained a brew from
which the dancers at intervals dipped with a gourd
cup and drank.</p>
<p>Outside the cave, the wind howled an accompaniment
to the wild ceremony, covering the shrill shrieks
and savage laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen enough of this!&rdquo; whispered Penny.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get the police and break it up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Lorinda. &ldquo;I hate to turn Ant&oacute;n
and Celeste over to the authorities, but I&rsquo;m convinced
now they have reverted to heathen ways, and may
even be responsible for Mother&rsquo;s sickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started to retreat, making no sound. In the
darkness Lorinda stumbled over a small rock. She
made no outcry as she saved herself from a fall, but
her shoes scuffed noisily and her body thudded heavily
against the wall.</p>
<p>Instantly the Zudi drum ceased its rhythm. &ldquo;What
was that?&rdquo; they heard Celeste ask sharply.</p>
<p>The girls huddled against the wall. An instant
later, Ant&oacute;n, a torch in his hand, peered down the
tunnel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>His cry told the girls they had been seen. In panic,
they started down the passageway with Ant&oacute;n in hot
pursuit. And close at his heels came Celeste and her
followers.</p>
<p>Escape was impossible. Before the girls had gone
a half dozen yards they were overtaken. Though
they struggled to free themselves, Ant&oacute;n&rsquo;s grasp was
like a steel bracelet upon their arms. They were half
dragged back to the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ant&oacute;n! Celeste! What is the meaning of this?&rdquo;
Lorinda demanded, seeking to regain control of the
servants by sheer power of will.</p>
<p>She tried to shake herself free, but Ant&oacute;n did not
release her. He awaited the word of his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tie them up!&rdquo; said Celeste harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste, have you lost your mind!&rdquo; Lorinda cried.</p>
<p>In the flickering light of the torch, the woman&rsquo;s
face was like a rigid mask. Eyes burned with hatred;
cheeks were deeply indrawn. Lorinda felt as if she
were gazing upon a stranger, and suddenly was afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dared to steal Father&rsquo;s drum!&rdquo; she challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now my drum,&rdquo; retorted Celeste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You spied upon me many times until you learned
the combination of the safe!&rdquo; Lorinda accused.</p>
<p>Celeste did not deny the charge. She was burrowing
behind the low altar and from the box-like structure
drew forth a long stout cord. Severing it with
the blade of a sharp knife, she handed the two pieces
to Ant&oacute;n who attempted to tie Lorinda&rsquo;s hands behind
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>The girl fought like a wild cat, and Penny, held by
one of Celeste&rsquo;s followers, sought to free herself, but
it was useless. She too was tightly bound and thrown
down on the floor of the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste, why are you doing this cruel thing?&rdquo; Lorinda
asked in a pleading tone. &ldquo;Does it mean nothing
to you that Father brought you here, fed you,
clothed you&mdash;gave you many advantages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Celeste softened and seemed to hesitate.
Lorinda was quick to press the advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father and my mother have been very kind to
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mention of her mother&rsquo;s name proved unfortunate.
Celeste&rsquo;s face hardened into rigid lines again and she
said furiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate her! May her flesh rot away and her bones
be torn asunder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste! And to think we ever trusted you!
Mother is ill because you have willed it so&mdash;it was you
who made the wicked effigy doll&mdash;you who kept
planting in her mind the idea that she would become
ill and die!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I have the will too!&rdquo; the woman said gleefully.
&ldquo;I told Ant&oacute;n to get it from the library! Then
I called you to your mother&rsquo;s room so he could snatch
it from the table!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you do it, Celeste? What have you
gained?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not steal my master&rsquo;s money! The will
is destroyed&mdash;burned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steal my stepfather&rsquo;s money? Indeed, you are out
of your mind, Celeste! My stepfather has disappeared
and may never be seen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; Lorinda cried eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste know&mdash;feel it here.&rdquo; The woman touched
her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen him&mdash;talked to him since he went
away!&rdquo; Lorinda accused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then unless you&rsquo;ve had a message from him, you
couldn&rsquo;t know whether he is alive or dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste know,&rdquo; the woman replied stubbornly.
&ldquo;We save the money for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my stepfather returns I&rsquo;ll be perfectly happy for
him to have Mother&rsquo;s estate. You&rsquo;re all mixed up,
Celeste. Now let&rsquo;s put an end to this nonsense.
Free us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; retorted the grim woman. &ldquo;Celeste and
Ant&oacute;n go away now. Perhaps find master. You will
stay in cave.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste, how did you know about this passage and
cave?&rdquo; Lorinda asked, stalling for time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ant&oacute;n help build it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should my stepfather build the passageway?&rdquo;
Lorinda murmured. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem like
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celeste did not answer. Gathering up the machete,
the Zudi drum, the embroidered altar cloth and other
stolen treasures, she prepared to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was you who whispered the warning at the
thatched cottage!&rdquo; accused Penny. &ldquo;You wanted to
prevent discovery of this cave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celeste&rsquo;s cruel smile acknowledged the truth. Saying
something to Ant&oacute;n in their own language, she
padded off down the passageway.</p>
<p>All save Ant&oacute;n now had gone. He blew out the
altar candles, picked up the pine torch and would have
blown out the cocoanut shell lamp, had Penny not
said pleadingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please leave us a tiny light, Ant&oacute;n. It will be so
dark here in the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man hesitated, glancing down the passage as if
fearful Celeste would punish him for such a display of
weakness. But he did as Penny requested. First,
however, he noted that the lamp was nearly empty of
oil and could not burn many minutes. Without extinguishing
it, he disappeared into the tunnel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Waiting only until she was certain Celeste, Ant&oacute;n
and their converts were out of the passage, Lorinda
said excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They forgot to gag us! We can shout for help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a hurricane roaring outside, it&rsquo;s a waste of
breath,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;No one will be on the beach
tonight, and our voices wouldn&rsquo;t carry a dozen yards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are we to do? Ant&oacute;n and Celeste
mean to run away now. The police never will be
able to find them unless we act quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea, but it may not work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny, her hands and feet securely tied, began to
roll toward the cocoanut oil lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you trying to do?&rdquo; Lorinda asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can burn the cords on my wrists. That&rsquo;s
why I asked Ant&oacute;n to leave the lamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you can!&rdquo; cried Lorinda, taking hope.
&ldquo;But it will be dangerous and very hard to do. The
oil is almost gone. You&rsquo;ll have to work fast, Penny,
or you&rsquo;ll lose your chance!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">22</span>
<br /><i>STRANGER IN THE STORM</i></h2>
<p>Penny squirmed and rolled until her hands
were very close to the cocoanut oil lamp on the rocky
floor of the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; Lorinda cried fearfully. &ldquo;If your
clothing should catch fire, nothing could save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny held her hands, which were bound behind
her back, over the flame. The heat seared her flesh
and made her wince with pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it up, Penny!&rdquo; encouraged her companion.
&ldquo;The cord is catching fire! But the lamp is almost
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gritted her teeth and endured the pain.
Then the lamp sputtered and went out, leaving the
cave to darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; wailed Lorinda in bitter disappointment.</p>
<p>Penny tugged at the wrist cords. Although not
severed, they were half burned through and weakened.
A hard jerk freed her hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Only a moment then was required to untie the cords
which held her feet. Next she freed Lorinda. As the
girls started to leave through the passageway, Penny
felt a cold blast of air upon her neck. Looking up,
she was able to distinguish a small opening in the wall
of the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can get out there!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Give me a boost and I&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda lifted her up. Scrambling like a monkey,
Penny secured a toe hold and crammed her head and
shoulders through the opening. A moment later she
ducked back to call to her friend:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get out all right! But the storm is getting
awful! I&rsquo;ll crawl out and then help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scrambling through the narrow opening, Penny
found herself amid the high rocks overlooking the
beach. The wind was blowing in puffs, each so powerful
that she nearly was dislodged from her precarious
perch.</p>
<p>Reaching back through the hole, Penny offered her
arms to Lorinda who succeeded in joining her. They
huddled in the lee of an overhanging rock, rain driving
into their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get word to the police!&rdquo; Penny said
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I must make certain Mother is safe!&rdquo; Lorinda
added. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been left too long alone. Ant&oacute;n and
Celeste may have gone back there, and in that case,
anything might happen!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>Slipping and sliding, the girls descended the rocks
to the beach. The river, lashed by a sheet of rain,
was dark and ugly. Much of the sand had been inundated
and water bubbled at their heels as they ran
toward the road.</p>
<p>A car swung toward them, its headlights blurred by
the rain. It parked at the curb, and the driver tooted
several times as if in signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks like Jerry&rsquo;s car!&rdquo; Penny cried hopefully.</p>
<p>It was, indeed, the reporter. He swung open the
automobile door, and as they recognized him, they
dashed across the road and gratefully slid into the
shelter offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you girls know better than to be running
around at a time like this?&rdquo; Jerry demanded severely.
&ldquo;Lucky I saw you streaking up the beach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brought you here?&rdquo; Penny gasped, taking
several deep breaths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brought me? Say, don&rsquo;t you realize we&rsquo;re
in for a real storm, and it&rsquo;s almost here! The radio ten
minutes ago reported that Oelwein, on the coast, has
been completely destroyed! I knew you came here
to do a little sleuthing, Penny, and I figured someone
ought to look after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Jerry,&rdquo; she returned gratefully. &ldquo;We
were in trouble&mdash;plenty of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>As the reporter drove on toward the Rhett mansion,
Penny quickly revealed what had happened. Jerry
made little comment, but his expression was grim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Ant&oacute;n and Celeste are here,&rdquo; he said as the
car reached the Rhett home. &ldquo;If they are, we&rsquo;ll
round &rsquo;em up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celeste and Ant&oacute;n, however, were not to be found
in the mansion. Their rooms remained deserted and
there was no indication that they had returned to the
house after leaving the cave.</p>
<p>Lorinda lost not a moment in hastening to her
mother&rsquo;s bedroom. To her relief, Mrs. Rhett was
sleeping quietly and did not awaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness, she is safe,&rdquo; the girl murmured.
&ldquo;After what happened in the cave, I feared the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to get the police on the trail of Ant&oacute;n
and Celeste before they make their escape,&rdquo; Jerry
urged. &ldquo;Once the full force of this storm strikes, no
one will be able to stir outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried the telephone but the line remained dead.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive to the police station,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;Are
you girls coming along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay with Mother,&rdquo; Lorinda said. &ldquo;She
mustn&rsquo;t be left alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hesitated, intending to remain with her
friend, but Jerry seized her by the arm. &ldquo;Your father
sent me out here to round you up, so I&rsquo;ll take you to
the newspaper office,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>As they opened the front door, rain poured in and
a great blast of wind nearly swept the pair from their
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; exclaimed the reporter, holding tight to
Penny as with heads lowered, they ran for the car.
&ldquo;This is it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The air was filled with flying objects, and a shingle
loosened from the mansion roof, hurtled against
Penny. Jerry pulled the car door open. The wind
seized it, nearly wrenching it off the hinges. Gusts
were of greater velocity now, with the intervals much
shorter.</p>
<p>For a dreadful moment, Penny and Jerry thought
the car would not start. The reporter jammed his
foot on the starter again and again and gave it the full
choke. Suddenly, the motor caught.</p>
<p>As they drove off along the river road, the force of
the wind was so great it required all of Jerry&rsquo;s strength
to keep the car straight on the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be lucky if we reach the police station!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;This is a lot worse than I figured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seizing the reporter&rsquo;s arm, Penny pointed to a
crouched figure visible on the road ahead. The
woman, hair flying in wild streamers, clutched a large
object in her arms, and was bent almost double as she
sought to move against the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Celeste!&rdquo; Penny cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Jerry brought the car to the roadside almost beside
the servant. Not until Penny and the reporter were
out of the automobile and almost upon her, did she see
them. Then with a startled cry, she turned to flee.
But it was too late. Jerry seized her by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming with us!&rdquo; he ordered sharply.</p>
<p>Battered and frightened by the force of the wind,
Celeste, surprisingly, made no protest. Clutching the
big Zudi drum, she allowed Jerry and Penny to pull
her into the shelter of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Ant&oacute;n?&rdquo; the reporter demanded.</p>
<p>Celeste&rsquo;s answer was a shrug. She gazed toward the
mansion grounds, and ignored the pair.</p>
<p>Jerry drove on. He glanced significantly at Penny
who guessed that he intended to take Celeste directly
to the police station.</p>
<p>However, as they approached the downtown section,
the wind blew with even greater power. Not a
vehicle was to be seen on the streets. The <i>Star</i> building
loomed up, but the police station was six blocks
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t make it,&rdquo; Jerry decided. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m turning
in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the double doors of the <i>Star</i> garage, where
trucks were usually loaded with their papers, stood
open. He drove inside, pulling up near the entrance
to the newspaper pressroom on the ground floor.</p>
<p>Celeste stirred to life, and made a move to get out
of the car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Jerry, pushing her back.
&ldquo;You and that drum stay with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celeste was of a different opinion. Glaring at
Jerry, she slapped at him, and again tried to get her
hand on the door handle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t hold her here,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;But I have
an idea! Penny, see if the pressroom door is unlocked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny ran to test it and found it unlocked. Now
that the extra was out, the pressmen had gathered in a
far corner of the big room filled with giant rotary
presses, to smoke and watch the storm.</p>
<p>Racing back to the car, Penny made her report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Jerry.</p>
<p>With Penny&rsquo;s help, he got Celeste out of the car,
separating her from the Zudi drum which they left
in the automobile. The woman stubbornly refused to
walk, so Jerry lifted her bodily and carried her kicking
and struggling into the pressroom.</p>
<p>Near the door was a large storage closet where tools
and oil for the presses were kept. Jerry shoved
Celeste into this room and turned a key in the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will hold her,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;While you
lock the Zudi drum in the car, I&rsquo;ll talk to the press
foreman and tell him what we&rsquo;ve done. Then Celeste
can squawk her head off and it will do no good.
We&rsquo;ll keep her here until the storm lets up and we can
get a police squad to pick her up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Penny ran back to the loading garage. It was deserted
now save for a lone delivery truck which stood
directly in front of the paper chute. Although his
cargo was loaded, the driver hesitated to try to deliver
until the storm abated.</p>
<p>Locking the car, Penny decided she would close the
one big double garage door where rain was blowing in.</p>
<p>The hurricane now roared in full fury. Peering out
into the deserted street, it seemed to Penny that no
person could stand against its strength. Yet as she
closed the doors, she was amazed to see a scurrying
figure.</p>
<p>The man, his hat gone, overcoat whipped between
his legs, grasped a corner of the building for support.</p>
<p>Seeing his face, Penny drew in her breath sharply.
A small jagged scar disfigured one cheek. As he
struggled past the door, she reached out and grasped
his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in here out of the wind,&rdquo; she urged. As she
gazed directly into his eyes, she added distinctly:
&ldquo;We have been looking for you a long while, Mr.
Rhett!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">23</span>
<br /><i>IN THE PRESSROOM</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You have made a mistake,&rdquo; the man mumbled.
&ldquo;I am not Mr. Rhett. My name is Brown&mdash;Edgar
Brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny, none too certain of the identification, gazed
at the man&rsquo;s hands. They were soft and white as if
unaccustomed to hard work, but he wore no serpent
ring on any of his fingers. She felt certain this was
the man she had met at the steamship office.</p>
<p>The stranger pulled gently away from her grasp,
ready to start out into the howling wind once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be swept off your feet if you try to battle
that storm!&rdquo; Penny protested. &ldquo;You must stay here
until the worst of it is over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not Mr. Rhett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about that,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;I mistook
you for someone else. Just come inside and I&rsquo;ll close
the doors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>The man peered outside once more, and noting the
intensity of the storm, lost all desire to leave the shelter.
He moved away from the entrance, and Penny
closed the big, heavy door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along with me into the pressroom where it
is warm,&rdquo; she invited.</p>
<p>Without comment, the man followed her across the
cement toward the loading docks. At the other end
of the drive, someone opened the doors for a moment
to allow a truck to roll inside. A great gust of wind
tore through the passage, and sent the stranger&rsquo;s hat
careening into a corner.</p>
<p>He darted to recapture it. As he stooped to pick
it up, an object on a string which he wore about his
neck, swung from beneath his sport shirt. Quickly
he pushed it out of sight again, but not before Penny
had seen the ring and recognized the serpent design.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>is</i> Mr. Rhett!&rdquo; she thought, her pulse pounding.</p>
<p>Wisely, she pretended to have observed nothing,
and invited him into the pressroom where Jerry was
waiting. Celeste, still locked in the storage closet, was
rattling the door knob and kicking on the panel with
all her strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; said Penny, dropping her bombshell.
&ldquo;This is Mr. Rhett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter&rsquo;s mouth dropped agape, while the
stranger plainly showed his annoyance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I am not Mr. Rhett.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then kindly explain the significance of that ring
you wear around your neck. I saw it only a moment
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger became confused. &ldquo;My ring&mdash;&rdquo; he
stammered. &ldquo;Oh, that! An heirloom. I have had it
for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell us the truth,&rdquo; pleaded Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing about this man you call Mr.
Rhett,&rdquo; he replied, avoiding her direct gaze. &ldquo;Evidently
you have someone locked up here. Suppose
you explain the meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;We do have someone
imprisoned in the storage room ready to turn over to
the police as soon as the storm lets up. It is Celeste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste!&rdquo; The stranger&rsquo;s amazed expression betrayed
him. Although he added: &ldquo;And who is she?&rdquo;
it was unconvincing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rhett, why pretend?&rdquo; Penny demanded.
&ldquo;We know who you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the man, smiling faintly. &ldquo;So I
am Mr. Rhett! I assume you two are reporters for
the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; agreed Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want a story. Well, there&rsquo;s no story.
Since you have me dead to rights as they say, I&rsquo;ll not
deny I am Hamilton Rhett. However, my identity
is my own affair. I stepped out of my old life&mdash;the
bank and my home&mdash;because I was tired of a very
boring existence. I never was cut to the cloth of a
banker. I dislike being shut up indoors even for an
hour. Probably I shall return to South America.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You say it is your own affair,&rdquo; Penny remarked
pointedly. &ldquo;I am afraid it isn&rsquo;t. Aren&rsquo;t you forgetting
a little matter of $250,000?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refer to that sum in negotiable bonds which you
had in your possession at the time you left the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rhett did not seem to understand for a moment.
Then he exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, the bonds! I was to have
returned them to the vault, but it slipped my mind.
You will find them in the top desk drawer in my
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The desk has been carefully searched. The bonds
are not there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not there?&rdquo; For the first time Mr. Rhett seemed
disturbed. &ldquo;But they must be, unless they were stolen
after I went away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bonds have not been found, and the bank
trustees are pressing your family to make restitution.
Furthermore, your wife is dangerously ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife sick? What is wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctors do not know. However, Lorinda
burned an effigy doll made in your wife&rsquo;s image&mdash;she
found it in the house. Two burned match sticks tied
together also were found by Mrs. Rhett. For some
reason she became obsessed with the idea she was
doomed to a lingering fatal illness. She began to refuse
food and since then has gone steadily downhill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The work of Celeste!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think so. Tonight she stole the Zudi drum,
and Lorinda and I found her with Ant&oacute;n and other
followers celebrating their rites in a cave near the
beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they have reverted to their heathen ways!&rdquo;
the banker exclaimed. &ldquo;My wife always said Celeste
hated her, but I, like a blind fool, refused to see it.
Once during the years I spent in the jungle, Celeste
saved my life and I always felt grateful to her. Now
I must forget that, for she is a dangerous woman if
she seeks to practice her jungle magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t actually believe Celeste could make
your wife ill merely by suggestion?&rdquo; Jerry inquired
in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the jungles I have seen a native die from superficial
wounds. If told the spear which struck him had
been sung over by an enemy, the native would simply
lie down, refuse food and pine away. My wife is in
great danger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can nothing be done?&rdquo; cried Penny.</p>
<p>Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s face tightened into hard, grim lines.
&ldquo;A great deal can be done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But Celeste
must be fought with her own jungle weapons. To
turn her over to the police will not be sufficient. She
is inside the closet you say&mdash;let me talk to her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; agreed Jerry, &ldquo;but Celeste in her present
mood is a pretty brisk customer. To make sure she
doesn&rsquo;t get away, I&rsquo;ll lock the pressroom door before
letting her out of her cage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the reporter went to the exit, Penny heard the
pressmen at the other end of the room shout that the
storm had abated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hurricane has not passed,&rdquo; corrected Mr.
Rhett quietly. &ldquo;This lull merely marks the end of the
first phase. The wind will return harder than ever in
a few minutes from another quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry returned, and taking the key to the storage
room from his pocket, cautiously unlocked the door.
Celeste, blinking like an owl as she staggered out
under the electric lights, gasped as she saw Mr. Rhett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master!&rdquo; she exclaimed worshipfully. &ldquo;You come
back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s face showed no trace of the affection
he had felt for his servant. &ldquo;Celeste,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
been dabbling in magic again! What&rsquo;s this nonsense
about my wife being ill and going to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth, Master. Ant&oacute;n and I try hard to save
her, but no use. She die next month. Maybe sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get this through your head, Celeste. My wife
will not die. She will be as well as you are within two
days. All your incantations over the doll were
wasted. You plotted to no avail. I am home now,
and if you persist in your wickedness, I will meet
your so-called magic with stronger magic of my
own!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste sorry,&rdquo; the old woman whimpered. &ldquo;Do
it only to get money for master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need no money and want none. You have been
very wicked, Celeste, and must be turned over to the
police for safe keeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Master! Not the police!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and now is the time to take you there during
this lull in the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celeste&rsquo;s wild eyes darted about the room, searching
for a means of escape. With a savage lunge, she
reached the door only to find it locked.</p>
<p>As Jerry and Mr. Rhett bore down upon her, she
scurried frantically along the outer room wall, coming
to the metal paper chute through which packages of
freshly-printed papers were tossed for delivery.</p>
<p>Quick as a cat, Celeste scrambled into the chute,
crawling through on all fours. At the chute&rsquo;s exit on
the sheltered cement drive, stood the waiting paper
truck, its rear door ajar. Already loaded, the driver
awaited only this lull in the storm before setting off to
deliver his cargo.</p>
<p>Even as Celeste crawled through the chute, the man
started the truck engine. The woman did not hesitate.
Leaping into the rear of the vehicle, she slammed the
door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Hearing it close, the driver assumed another workman
had shut it as a signal for him to pull out. Shifting
gears, he drove away with his cargo of papers&mdash;and
Celeste.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">24</span>
<br /><i>THE GRINNING GARGOYLE</i></h2>
<p>By the time Jerry, Penny and Mr. Rhett unlocked
the pressroom door and reached the loading dock, the
truck bearing Celeste was far down the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, where&rsquo;d that truck go?&rdquo; the reporter shouted
to another workman at the far end of the drive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Docks at the end of Basset Street,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;A batch o&rsquo; papers go aboard the <i>Monclove</i> for shipment
to Presque Isle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s car stood close by. He sprang in, making
room for Penny and Mr. Rhett.</p>
<p>The newspaper truck had disappeared by the time
they drove out on the street. Jerry took a short-cut
route to the Basset Street docks. Signs and debris of
all description cluttered the roadway. Rain had
ceased, but the ominous quiet, the heaviness of the air,
was even more frightening than the wind had been.</p>
<p>In a distant section of the city they heard the high-pitched
whistle of a police siren; otherwise, the streets
were as silent as the tomb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>The car turned a corner, and directly ahead Penny
glimpsed the newspaper truck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; she cried, but Jerry also had seen the
vehicle.</p>
<p>He put on speed, and was close behind as the truck
pulled up with a jerk at Dock 12. Green water
whipped to foam, crashed with heavy impact against
the dock posts and flooded out on the slippery planking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have much time!&rdquo; Mr. Rhett exclaimed.
&ldquo;When the next phase of the storm comes&mdash;and it&rsquo;s
close now&mdash;the wind will be terrific!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men, with Penny close behind, leaped from the
car. Quick as they were, Celeste was out of the truck
before they could reach its door.</p>
<p>She stopped short as she saw the trio, then like a
trapped animal, turned and fled in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Celeste!&rdquo; Mr. Rhett shouted. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman paid no attention. Splashing ankle-deep
through water that washed the dock planks, she
ran precariously close to the river&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>A hoarse shout from behind caused Penny to turn.
The driver of the truck was gesturing and pointing
first to the dark sky and then to an open shed. For a
moment she did not understand, but as he ran for the
shelter, she heard the deep-throated roar of the hurricane
as it returned for its final onslaught.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; cried Mr. Rhett who also recognized the
danger. &ldquo;Inside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three ran back to the shed where the truck-driver
had taken shelter. Although they shouted
again and again to Celeste, she ignored their warnings.</p>
<p>As the wind struck, they saw her at the very edge
of the dock. She half turned toward the shed as if
debating whether or not to seek its shelter, then took
a step or two in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>A great gust lifted off a section of the shed roof
and whirled it away. As the full impact of the wind
swept around the building, Celeste clung to a dock
post for an instant; then her fingers lost their grip, and
with a scream, she toppled over the edge into the
churning water.</p>
<p>Jerry started toward the door, but Mr. Rhett seized
his arm, dragging him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool! Celeste is beyond help! You&rsquo;ll
only lose your own life if you venture out there now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already Celeste had disappeared beneath the turbulent
waters, leaving no trace. Anxiously those in the
shed watched but her head never appeared above the
surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Celeste,&rdquo; said Mr. Rhett sadly. &ldquo;She meant
well, but she was superstitious and misguided. However,
she would have pined away in captivity. Perhaps
she went the best way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>The servant&rsquo;s startling death placed a pall upon the
four who huddled in the shed. Close together, they
flattened themselves against the wall, expecting at any
moment that the entire building would be lifted from
its foundation and hurled into the river. The force
of the wind was almost unbelievable.</p>
<p>After nearly a half hour, the gusts lost their strength
and Mr. Rhett declared that the greatest danger had
been passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me everything that happened while I was
away,&rdquo; he requested Penny and Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; promised Penny, &ldquo;but first, suppose you
explain why you went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I did tell you.&rdquo; Mr. Rhett drew a deep
sigh. &ldquo;For many months I considered retiring from
the bank. I discussed it with my wife, but she failed
to see my viewpoint and insisted that I remain. We
became deadlocked, so to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried for her sake to force myself to like bank
work, but it was utterly impossible. Each day I
found myself longing for the old carefree adventurous
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you quietly walked out?&rdquo; Jerry supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that. My actions weren&rsquo;t premeditated.
One thing led to another. I had a quarrel
with my wife over neglect of bank duties. As I sat
thinking it over at my desk, it struck me that Lorinda
and her mother probably would be happier if I removed
myself from the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you write anything as you sat there?&rdquo; Penny
interposed eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you draw a picture of a plumed serpent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe so, though it was only absent-minded
doodling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And beneath the drawing you wrote, &lsquo;This shall
be the end.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I did,&rdquo; the man acknowledged. &ldquo;I had
decided to walk out and those words expressed the
conclusion I reached. I wrote the thought absent-mindedly
and never intended it to fall into anyone&rsquo;s
hands. Did I leave the paper in the desk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police found it there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have been quite upset,&rdquo; Mr. Rhett said,
frowning. &ldquo;At any rate, I walked out with less than
three dollars in my pocket, and didn&rsquo;t realize until
later that I was without funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you took lodging in a cheap flop house on
Cherry Street?&rdquo; Jerry interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you seem to have followed my actions very
closely. Although the lodgings were hardly deluxe,
I did not mind the experience. I frequently have slept
on the ground or in native huts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stayed there only one night?&rdquo; Penny inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Another lodger told me two persons had come to
ask questions about a man who wore a serpent ring,&rdquo;
Mr. Rhett said. &ldquo;Not wishing to be found, I removed
the ring from my finger, and found another lodging
place. When my money ran out, I picked up a little
work as a laborer at one of the mills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you inquiring at one of the steamship ticket
offices,&rdquo; Penny reminded him. &ldquo;You remember that,
I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sought to work my passage on a boat going to
South America,&rdquo; Mr. Rhett explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this time, didn&rsquo;t you read the newspapers?&rdquo;
Jerry asked curiously. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know the bonds
were missing and that your wife was ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rhett shook his head. &ldquo;I purposely avoided
looking at the newspapers. I was afraid if I did I
might be tempted to return to my old life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now?&rdquo; asked Penny softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no future, only the present. Before making
any plans, I must return home to see that my wife
frees her mind from Celeste&rsquo;s evil suggestions. I
made a great mistake in bringing Celeste and Ant&oacute;n
into the household. But once my wife knows Celeste
is dead, I am confident she will quickly recover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still love your wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall always love her,&rdquo; he returned quietly, &ldquo;but
she has no use for me. I&rsquo;ve been a drag on her since
the day we were married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t feel that way, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Penny corrected.
&ldquo;Since you went away, she&rsquo;s been heartbroken.
Lorinda needs you too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can never return to the bank,&rdquo; Mr. Rhett repeated.
&ldquo;And there are the stolen bonds to be considered.
Why, the police may even arrest me! I&rsquo;m
all mixed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matters will straighten out as soon as you see your
wife,&rdquo; Penny declared. &ldquo;However, I&rsquo;ll admit recovering
the bonds may not be so easy. To my
knowledge, the police haven&rsquo;t a single clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry was peering out the open shed door. &ldquo;The
storm is letting up,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon be able to
get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another half hour and the wind died sufficiently so
that the party could safely leave the shelter. The
truck driver returned to the newspaper office, while
Jerry and Penny drove Mr. Rhett to his home.</p>
<p>The mansion yard was cluttered with uprooted
trees, boards and debris. Penny ran down the path
a short distance and returned to report that the
thatched roof cottage had vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is just as well,&rdquo; said Mr. Rhett. &ldquo;It was
a mistake to build the cottage, but Celeste first put the
idea in my head. I intended to use it only as a trophy
room, but to Celeste it became a living symbol of the
life she had left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you build the passageway leading to the
cave and to Celeste&rsquo;s room?&rdquo; Penny inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s blank expression told her that he did
not understand. After she had explained, he said
grimly: &ldquo;Ant&oacute;n and Celeste must have dug the tunnel
without my knowledge! Oh, they were a cunning
pair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Ant&oacute;n still is on the loose,&rdquo; Jerry reminded
the banker. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to notify the police to pick
him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rhett and the young people entered the house.
Lorinda, startled by hearing the front door open, ran
to the head of the stairway. Seeing her stepfather, she
gave a cry of joy and raced to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come back! Oh, Mother needs you so
badly. Do go to her at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rhett needed no urging. He was up the steps
two at a time. Jerry and Penny, not wishing to intrude,
remained in the living room, but a few minutes
later, Lorinda called them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, everything is wonderful!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Mother and Father have adjusted all their differences.
And best of all, she&rsquo;s already half over the idea she is
going to die. Why, he just told her Celeste was dead
and that she could never do any further harm. Mother
snapped right out of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorinda insisted that Jerry and Penny go upstairs.
Mrs. Rhett was sitting up in bed, and her eyes were
shining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How silly I&rsquo;ve been,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;As I look
back, I realize Celeste hated me and kept putting ideas
in my mind. Why, I feel much better already.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hungry?&rdquo; asked Lorinda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I am. I must have a gigantic dinner
tonight.&rdquo; Mrs. Rhett laughed and added: &ldquo;With
everything well salted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the bank&mdash;&rdquo; began Mr. Rhett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not talk about it now,&rdquo; his wife pleaded. &ldquo;I
was wrong about that too. I&rsquo;ll never ask you to go
back there, for it isn&rsquo;t your type of life. Instead, perhaps
we can go away somewhere on a long trip&mdash;South
America, would that appeal to you, Hamilton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it?&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Someone has been
putting ideas in your head, and this time it wasn&rsquo;t
Celeste!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anxious to return to the newspaper office and to
stop at the police station, Jerry and Penny soon took
leave of the Rhetts, after receiving urgent invitations
to return later that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it appears everything is turning out hunkey
dorey for the Rhetts,&rdquo; Jerry observed as he and Penny
drove away from the mansion. &ldquo;Ant&oacute;n is certain to
be caught by the police, and those followers of his
will be jailed too if they ever show their faces again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything <i>might</i> be fine for the Rhetts except
for one thing,&rdquo; Penny returned. &ldquo;Mrs. Rhett doesn&rsquo;t
have much ready cash available, and there still remains
a little matter of $250,000 in missing bonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten about that. You&rsquo;re right, Rhett still
is in an awkward spot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>The car drove into the downtown section where a
few vehicles now were moving. Under the glow of
the street lights, workmen were clearing the debris
away.</p>
<p>As the car approached the First National Bank,
Penny chanced to raise her eyes toward the second
story balcony fronting the street. The grinning
gargoyles stood out in dark relief, and as she gazed at
them, she suddenly saw a shadowy figure moving
stealthily toward the one nearest the open door leading
from Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s private office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that looks like Albert Potts!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>As she watched in amazement, the man approached
the gargoyle. Reaching his hand far in between the
open jaws, he removed something which he thrust
into his overcoat pocket. Then, with a nervous glance
down upon the deserted street, he stepped back into
Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s office, and closed the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">25</span>
<br /><i>ON THE BALCONY</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry, that was Albert Potts on the balcony!&rdquo;
Penny cried excitedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I saw him remove an
object from inside the gargoyle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he was just looking to see what damage
was done by the storm,&rdquo; commented the reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took something out and put it in his overcoat
pocket! Jerry, now that I think back, Potts acted
queerly that first day when the police investigated Mr.
Rhett&rsquo;s office. He didn&rsquo;t want anyone to go near the
gargoyle! Another thing, he&rsquo;s been spending money
as if it were rainwater!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re suggesting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it was Albert Potts who stole the bonds!
Weren&rsquo;t they left in Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s desk? Potts knew it
and had a perfect chance to take them! He implied
that Rhett walked off with them! Actually, he hid
the bonds in the gargoyle, knowing that if they were
found there, no blame would be likely to fall upon
him. Whenever he needed money, he cashed a bond&mdash;that&rsquo;s
why only a few have shown up at out of town
banks!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, maybe you have something!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jerry, pulling up at the curb. &ldquo;If he had hid the
bonds in the gargoyle, it would be natural for him to
wonder if they still were safe after this storm! He
might have decided to shift them to another place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idea exactly! Jerry, let&rsquo;s nab him and turn him
over to the police!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite so fast, my little chickadee. If we
accuse Potts, and it turns out we&rsquo;re wrong, well, he
could make it hot for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to take a chance,&rdquo; Penny urged.</p>
<p>Leaving the car at the curb, the pair walked hurriedly
to the bank. The building was dark and the
lights were off inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you saw Potts on the balcony?&rdquo; Jerry asked
as they huddled against the wall for protection against
the biting wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I think he&rsquo;s coming now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was correct. They heard footsteps coming
down the marble stairway, and a moment later, the
bank secretary unlocked the door. The waiting
couple made no move until he had locked himself out,
but as he started away, Jerry tapped him on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>Potts whirled around, obviously startled. His face
blanched.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Potts,&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;Working late, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; stammered the man, edging away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you spare a match?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Potts half reached into his pocket as if to proffer
one, then said testily: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any. Sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure now, you must have a match,&rdquo; said Jerry,
brushing against him. &ldquo;Maybe in your overcoat
pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Potts could prevent it, he had thrust his
hands deep into each of the outside pockets. The
bank clerk jerked angrily away. However, it was too
late. Jerry triumphantly brought to light a heavy
manila envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give that to me!&rdquo; Potts cried furiously.</p>
<p>Sidestepping him, Jerry pulled several bonds of
large denomination from the envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stolen bonds!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny. &ldquo;Mr. Potts,
whatever possessed you to do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bank secretary never answered the question.
Instead, he wheeled and started at a run down the
street. As he reached the corner, a policeman who
had just finished making a report to headquarters,
turned from his phone box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that man!&rdquo; yelled Jerry.</p>
<p>The policeman grasped Potts, bringing him up
short. After that, the bank secretary did his explaining
to the desk sergeant at police headquarters. So
unconvincing was his story, that he was immediately
locked in a cell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Meanwhile, Jerry and Penny related all they knew
about the case. All scout cars were ordered to be on
the alert to pick up Ant&oacute;n. Mr. Rhett was brought to
the station within the hour, and promptly identified
the recovered bonds as those he had left in his office
desk.</p>
<p>At first, Potts firmly maintained his innocence, but
after police had subjected him to a lie detector test,
he realized his case was lost. When one of the detectives
who was questioning him, remarked that his
wife likely would be implicated in the theft, Potts
broke completely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! My wife had nothing to do with it,&rdquo; he
insisted. &ldquo;I wanted to give my family better things&mdash;that
was why I took the bonds. I thought Mr. Rhett
would never return and that he would be blamed for
the theft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you cash the bonds?&rdquo; he was asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid to take them to a bank myself,&rdquo; Potts
confessed. &ldquo;Instead, I paid a woman in another town
to do it for me. But she did it only as a favor, and
had no idea the bonds were stolen. I alone am to
blame.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>A check by police revealed that Potts had spent
only $2,000 of the total amount stolen. Mr. Rhett
declared that this sum easily could be made up, so
that the bank would sustain no loss. He was inclined
to be lenient with his secretary, but police were insistent
that the man be brought to trial.</p>
<p>Jerry and Penny, knowing that they had a big
story to write, did not tarry long at the police station.
However, the police desk sergeant promised to keep
them informed of any new developments in the case.
True to his word, he called them soon after they
reached the <i>Star</i> office. His news was that Ant&oacute;n had
been captured by the police and now was safely
locked in a jail cell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that rings the gong on the case,&rdquo; Jerry announced
as he hung up the telephone. &ldquo;Thanks to
you, Penny, it&rsquo;s all wound up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s nearly edition time!&rdquo; barked the city
editor. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get going on that story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at Jerry who was known as the best
writer on the paper, and then his eyes moved on to
Penny who waited with bated breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was her story from start to finish,&rdquo; said Jerry
as the editor hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get going!&rdquo; ordered the editor again, and now he
looked straight at Penny. &ldquo;Give it to me in takes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hurried to a typewriter. The lead, telling
of Mr. Rhett&rsquo;s return, Potts&rsquo; arrest and recovery of
the stolen bonds, almost wrote itself. Keeping her
own part and Jerry&rsquo;s entirely out of the story, she
wrote smoothly and with speed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>When she had finished half a page, she called:
&ldquo;Copy boy!&rdquo; and ripping the sheet of paper from the
typewriter gave it to him to carry to the editor&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>With a fresh sheet in the machine, she wrote on
until she had a second &ldquo;take&rdquo; ready. Again she called
the copy boy and, as he snatched it from her hand,
rolled still another sheet into the typewriter.</p>
<p>At last she was on the final page and glanced over
it before she typed &ldquo;30&rdquo; at the end. The story had
been well told, written tersely in the manner DeWitt
liked. With a feeling of exultation, she realized she
had done a good job.</p>
<p>Getting to her feet, she dropped the last page into
the copy basket. Earlier sheets already had been
copy-read and were in the process of being set into
type. Any moment now, the edition would roll and
papers would be on the street.</p>
<p>Penny turned from the desk to see Jerry sitting
with his feet propped up on one of the tables. He was
gazing at her quizzically and grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you did it again, Penny!&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did it together,&rdquo; she corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the help of our silent partner,&rdquo; he added
lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silent partner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hurricane. It damaged a lot of Riverview
property, but on the other side of the ledger, it helped
write &lsquo;30&rsquo; to the Rhett case.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Penny nodded as she reached for her hat and raincoat.
Just then, a copy boy ran up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telephone for you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your housekeeper,
Mrs. Weems. She wants to know if you&rsquo;re
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe and sound and on my way home,&rdquo; laughed
Penny. &ldquo;Tell her I&rsquo;ve already started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that she&rsquo;s being driven by her faithful chauffeur,&rdquo;
chuckled Jerry, as he reached for his hat.
&ldquo;Which reminds me, we have a little package to deliver
to the Rhetts&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Zudi drum! I forgot all about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you forgotten another important matter
too?&rdquo; teased Jerry, escorting her through the swinging
gate. &ldquo;Me, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My reward for tonight&rsquo;s work. Girl reporters,
even cute little numbers like you, can&rsquo;t snatch my bylines
without paying the piper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what fee do you require?&rdquo; Penny asked with
pretended innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go into that later,&rdquo; he chuckled, pinning
her neatly into a shadowy corner of the vestibule.
&ldquo;Just now, I&rsquo;ll take a little kiss on deposit!&rdquo;</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
